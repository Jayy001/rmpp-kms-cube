.IP \(bu 4
In Perl 5.20.0, \f(CW$^N\fR accidentally had the internal UTF8 flag turned off if
accessed from a code block within a regular expression, effectively
UTF8\-encoding the value.  This has been fixed.
[GH #14211] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14211>
.IP \(bu 4
Various cases where the name of a sub is used (autoload, overloading, error
messages) used to crash for lexical subs, but have been fixed.

fixed.
[GH #14087] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14087>
.IP \(bu 4
Loading UTF8 tables during a regular expression match could cause assertion
failures under debugging builds if the previous match used the very same
regular expression.
[GH #14081] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14081>
.IP \(bu 4
Due to a mistake in the string-copying logic, copying the value of a state
variable could instead steal the value and undefine the variable.  This bug,
introduced in Perl 5.20, would happen mostly for long strings (1250 chars or
more), but could happen for any strings under builds with copy-on-write
disabled.
[GH #14175] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14175>
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed a bug that could cause perl to execute an infinite loop during
compilation.
[GH #14165] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14165>
.IP \(bu 4
On Win32, restoring in a child pseudo-process a variable that was \f(CWlocal()\fRed
in a parent pseudo-process before the \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR happened caused memory corruption
and a crash in the child pseudo-process (and therefore OS process).
[GH #8641] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/8641>
.IP \(bu 4
Tainted constants evaluated at compile time no longer cause unrelated
statements to become tainted.
[GH #14059] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14059>
.IP \(bu 4
Calling \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR on a format with a \f(CW\*(C`^**\*(C'\fR field could produce a panic in
\&\fBsv_chop()\fR if there were insufficient arguments or if the variable used to fill
the field was empty.
[GH #14255] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14255>
.IP \(bu 4
In Perl 5.20.0, \f(CW\*(C`sort CORE::fake\*(C'\fR where 'fake' is anything other than a
keyword started chopping of the last 6 characters and treating the result as a
sort sub name.  The previous behaviour of treating "CORE::fake" as a sort sub
name has been restored.
[GH #14323] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14323>
.IP \(bu 4
A bug in regular expression patterns that could lead to segfaults and other
crashes has been fixed.  This occurred only in patterns compiled with \f(CW"/i"\fR,
while taking into account the current POSIX locale (this usually means they
have to be compiled within the scope of \f(CW"use\ locale"\fR), and there must be
a string of at least 128 consecutive bytes to match.
[GH #14389] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14389>
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`qr/@array(?{block})/\*(C'\fR no longer dies with "Bizarre copy of ARRAY".

\&\f(CW\*(C`gmtime\*(C'\fR no longer crashes with not-a-number values.
[GH #14365] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14365>
.IP \(bu 4
Certain syntax errors in substitutions, such as \f(CW\*(C`s/${<>{})//\*(C'\fR, would
crash, and had done so since Perl 5.10.  (In some cases the crash did not start
happening until Perl 5.16.)  The crash has, of course, been fixed.
[GH #14391] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14391>
.IP \(bu 4
A memory leak in some regular expressions, introduced in Perl 5.20.1, has been
fixed.
[GH #14236] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14236>
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`formline("@...", "a");\*(C'\fR would crash.  The \f(CW\*(C`FF_CHECKNL\*(C'\fR case in
\&\fBpp_formline()\fR didn't set the pointer used to mark the chop position, which led
to the \f(CW\*(C`FF_MORE\*(C'\fR case crashing with a segmentation fault.  This has been
fixed.
[GH #14388] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14388>
[GH #14425] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14425>

.IP \(bu 4
It is a known bug that lexical subroutines cannot be used as the \f(CW\*(C`SUBNAME\*(C'\fR
argument to \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR.  This will be fixed in a future version of Perl.
.SH "Errata From Previous Releases"

A regression has been fixed that was introduced in Perl 5.20.0 (fixed in Perl

that contains a single ASCII lowercase letter does not match its uppercase
counterpart.

.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ ,
the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
