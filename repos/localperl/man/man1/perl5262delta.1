A crafted regular expression could cause a heap buffer write overflow, with

This has been updated to note that \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Word}\*(C'\fR now includes code points
matching the \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Join_Control}\*(C'\fR property.  The change to the property was made
in Perl 5.18, but not documented until now.  There are currently only two code
points that match this property: U+200C (ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER) and U+200D
(ZERO WIDTH JOINER).

The \f(CWreadpipe()\fR built-in function now checks at compile time that it has only
one parameter expression, and puts it in scalar context, thus ensuring that it
doesn't corrupt the stack at runtime.

[GH #16124] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16124>
.IP \(bu 4
Parsing a \f(CW\*(C`sub\*(C'\fR definition could cause a use after free if the \f(CW\*(C`sub\*(C'\fR keyword
was followed by whitespace including newlines (and comments).
[GH #16097] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16097>

The tokenizer now correctly adjusts a parse pointer when skipping whitespace in
an \f(CW\*(C` ${identifier} \*(C'\fR construct.

operations on a non-glob.
[GH #15372] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15372>
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR now performs correct reference counting when aliasing \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR,
thus avoiding premature destruction and leakage of scalars if they are
re-aliased during execution of the sort comparator.

Some convoluted kinds of regexp no longer cause an arithmetic overflow when
compiled.

.IP \(bu 4
Fixed a duplicate symbol failure with \fB\-flto \-mieee\-fp\fR builds.  \fIpp.c\fR
defined \f(CW\*(C`_LIB_VERSION\*(C'\fR which \fB\-lieee\fR already defines.

A NULL pointer dereference in the \f(CWS_regmatch()\fR function has been fixed.
[perl #132017] <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132017>
.IP \(bu 4
Failures while compiling code within other constructs, such as with string
interpolation and the right part of \f(CW\*(C`s///e\*(C'\fR now cause compilation to abort
earlier.
.Sp
Previously compilation could continue in order to report other errors, but the
failed sub-parse could leave partly parsed constructs on the parser
shift-reduce stack, confusing the parser, leading to perl crashes.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.
