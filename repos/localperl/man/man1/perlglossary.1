.SS A
.IX Subsection "A"
.IP "accessor methods" 4
.IX Item "accessor methods"
A \fBmethod\fR used to
indirectly inspect or update an \fBobject\fR’s state (its \fBinstance
variables\fR).
.IX Xref "accessor methods, defined methods, accessor"
.IP "actual arguments" 4
.IX Item "actual arguments"
The \fBscalar values\fR that you supply
to a \fBfunction\fR or \fBsubroutine\fR when you call it. For instance, when you
call \f(CWpower("puff")\fR, the string \f(CW"puff"\fR is the actual argument. See also
\&\fBargument\fR and \fBformal arguments\fR.
.IX Xref "actual arguments arguments, actual"
.IP "address operator" 4
.IX Item "address operator"
Some languages work directly with the memory addresses of
values, but this can be like playing with fire. Perl provides a set of
asbestos gloves for handling all memory management. The closest to an
address operator in Perl is the backslash operator, but it gives you a
\&\fBhard reference\fR, which is much safer than a memory address.
.IX Xref "address operator"
.IP algorithm 4
.IX Item "algorithm"
A well-defined sequence of steps, explained clearly
enough that even a computer could do them.
.IX Xref "algorithms (term)"
.IP alias 4
.IX Item "alias"
A nickname for something, which behaves in all ways as
though you’d used the original name instead of the nickname. Temporary
aliases are implicitly created in the loop variable for \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR loops, in
the \f(CW$_\fR variable for \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR operators, in \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR
during \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR’s comparison function, and in each element of \f(CW@_\fR for the
\&\fBactual arguments\fR of a subroutine call. Permanent aliases are explicitly
created in \fBpackages\fR by \fBimporting\fR symbols or by assignment to
\&\fBtypeglobs\fR. Lexically scoped aliases for package variables are explicitly
created by the \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR declaration.
.IX Xref "aliases, defined"
.IP alphabetic 4
.IX Item "alphabetic"
The sort of characters we put into words. In Unicode, this
is all letters including all ideographs and certain diacritics, letter
numbers like Roman numerals, and various combining marks.
.IX Xref "alphabetic sort"
.IP alternatives 4
.IX Item "alternatives"
A list of possible choices from which you may
select only one, as in, “Would you like door A, B, or C?” Alternatives in
regular expressions are separated with a single vertical bar: \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR.
Alternatives in normal Perl expressions are separated with a double vertical
bar: \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR. Logical alternatives in \fBBoolean\fR expressions are separated
with either \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`or\*(C'\fR.
.IX Xref "alternative characters"
.IP anonymous 4
.IX Item "anonymous"
Used to describe a \fBreferent\fR
that is not directly accessible through a named \fBvariable\fR. Such a referent
must be indirectly accessible through at least one \fBhard reference\fR. When
the last hard reference goes away, the anonymous referent is destroyed
without pity.
.IX Xref "anonymous referents referents, anonymous"
.IP application 4
.IX Item "application"
A bigger, fancier sort of \fBprogram\fR with a fancier
name so people don’t realize they are using a program.
.IX Xref "applications (term)"
.IP architecture 4
.IX Item "architecture"
The kind of computer you’re working on, where one “kind of
computer” means all those computers sharing a compatible machine language.
Since Perl programs are (typically) simple text files, not executable
images, a Perl program is much less sensitive to the architecture it’s
running on than programs in other languages, such as C, that are \fBcompiled\fR
into machine code. See also \fBplatform\fR and \fBoperating system\fR.
.IX Xref "architecture"
.IP argument 4
.IX Item "argument"
A piece of data supplied to a \fBprogram\fR,
\&\fBsubroutine\fR, \fBfunction\fR, or \fBmethod\fR to tell it what it’s supposed to
do. Also called a “parameter”.
.IX Xref "arguments, defined"
.IP ARGV 4
.IX Item "ARGV"
The name of the array containing the \fBargument\fR \fBvector\fR
from the command line. If you use the empty \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR operator, \f(CW\*(C`ARGV\*(C'\fR
is the name of both the \fBfilehandle\fR used to traverse the arguments and the
\&\fBscalar\fR containing the name of the current input file.
.IX Xref "ARGV filehandle"
.IP "arithmetical operator" 4
.IX Item "arithmetical operator"
A \fBsymbol\fR such as \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR that tells
Perl to do the arithmetic you were supposed to learn in grade school.
.IX Xref "arithmetic operators, about"
.IP array 4
.IX Item "array"
An ordered sequence of \fBvalues\fR, stored such that you can
easily access any of the values using an \fIinteger subscript\fR that specifies
the value’s \fBoffset\fR in the sequence.
.IX Xref "arrays, defined"
.IP "array context" 4
.IX Item "array context"
An archaic expression for what is more correctly referred to
as \fBlist context\fR.
.IX Xref "array context"
.IP "Artistic License" 4
.IX Item "Artistic License"
The open source license that Larry Wall
created for Perl, maximizing Perl’s usefulness, availability, and
modifiability. The current version is 2. (<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic\-license.php>).
.IX Xref "Artistic License Wall, Larry"
.IP ASCII 4
.IX Item "ASCII"
The American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (a 7\-bit character set adequate only for poorly
representing English text). Often used loosely to describe the lowest 128
values of the various ISO\-8859\-X character sets, a bunch of mutually
incompatible 8\-bit codes best described as half ASCII. See also \fBUnicode\fR.
.IX Xref "ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)"
.IP assertion 4
.IX Item "assertion"
A component of a \fBregular expression\fR that must be true for the pattern to
match but does not necessarily match any characters itself. Often used
specifically to mean a \fBzero-width\fR assertion.
.IX Xref "assertions (in regexes), defined regular expressions, assertions in"
.IP assignment 4
.IX Item "assignment"
An \fBoperator\fR whose assigned mission in life is to
change the value of a \fBvariable\fR.
.IX Xref "assignments, defined"
.IP "assignment operator" 4
.IX Item "assignment operator"
Either a regular \fBassignment\fR or a compound
\&\fBoperator\fR composed of an ordinary assignment and some other operator, that
changes the value of a variable in place; that is, relative to its old
value. For example, \f(CW\*(C`$a += 2\*(C'\fR adds \f(CW2\fR to \f(CW$a\fR.
.IX Xref "assignment operators, about"
.IP "associative array" 4
.IX Item "associative array"
See \fBhash\fR. Please. The term associative array is the
old Perl 4 term for a \fBhash\fR. Some languages call it a dictionary.
.IX Xref "associative arrays"
.IP associativity 4
.IX Item "associativity"
Determines whether you do the left \fBoperator\fR first or the
right \fBoperator\fR first when you have “A \fBoperator\fR B \fBoperator\fR C”, and
the two operators are of the same precedence. Operators like \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR are left
associative, while operators like \f(CW\*(C`**\*(C'\fR are right associative. See Camel
chapter 3, “Unary and Binary Operators” for a list of operators and their
associativity.
.IX Xref "associativity"
.IP asynchronous 4
.IX Item "asynchronous"
Said of events or activities whose relative
temporal ordering is indeterminate because too many things are going on at
once. Hence, an asynchronous event is one you didn’t know when to expect.
.IX Xref "asynchronous event processing"
.IP atom 4
.IX Item "atom"
A \fBregular expression\fR component potentially matching a
\&\fBsubstring\fR containing one or more characters and treated as an indivisible
syntactic unit by any following \fBquantifier\fR. (Contrast with an
\&\fBassertion\fR that matches something of \fBzero width\fR and may not be quantified.)
.IX Xref "atoms"
.IP "atomic operation" 4
.IX Item "atomic operation"
When Democritus gave the word “atom” to the indivisible
bits of matter, he meant literally something that could not be cut: \fIἀ\-\fR
(not) + \fI\-τομος\fR (cuttable). An atomic operation is an action that can’t be
interrupted, not one forbidden in a nuclear-free zone.
.IX Xref "atomic operation"
.IP attribute 4
.IX Item "attribute"
A new feature that allows the declaration of
\&\fBvariables\fR and \fBsubroutines\fR with modifiers, as in \f(CW\*(C`sub foo : locked
method\*(C'\fR. Also another name for an \fBinstance variable\fR of an \fBobject\fR.
.IX Xref "attribute feature"
.IP autogeneration 4
.IX Item "autogeneration"
A feature of \fBoperator overloading\fR of \fBobjects\fR,
whereby the behavior of certain \fBoperators\fR can be reasonably deduced using
more fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded operators will
often have the same relationships as the regular operators. See Camel
chapter 13, “Overloading”.
.IX Xref "autogeneration, about"
.IP autoincrement 4
.IX Item "autoincrement"
To add one to something automatically, hence the name
of the \f(CW\*(C`++\*(C'\fR operator. To instead subtract one from something automatically
is known as an “autodecrement”.
.IX Xref "autoincrement (term)"
.IP autoload 4
.IX Item "autoload"
To load on demand. (Also called “lazy” loading.)
Specifically, to call an \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR subroutine on behalf of an undefined
subroutine.
.IX Xref "autoloading, defined"
.IP autosplit 4
.IX Item "autosplit"
To split a string automatically, as the \fI–a\fR \fBswitch\fR
does when running under \fI–p\fR or \fI–n\fR in order to emulate \fBawk\fR. (See also
the \f(CW\*(C`AutoSplit\*(C'\fR module, which has nothing to do with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`–a\*(C'\fR switch but a lot to do with autoloading.)
.IX Xref "autosplit (term) AutoSplit module"
.IP autovivification 4
.IX Item "autovivification"
A Graeco-Roman word meaning “to bring oneself to life”.
In Perl, storage locations (\fBlvalues\fR) spontaneously generate themselves as
needed, including the creation of any \fBhard reference\fR values to point to
the next level of storage. The assignment \f(CW\*(C`$a[5][5][5][5][5] = "quintet"\*(C'\fR
potentially creates five scalar storage locations, plus four references (in
the first four scalar locations) pointing to four new anonymous arrays (to
hold the last four scalar locations). But the point of autovivification is
that you don’t have to worry about it.
.IX Xref "autovivification"
.IP AV 4
.IX Item "AV"
Short for “array
value”, which refers to one of Perl’s internal data types that holds an
\&\fBarray\fR. The \f(CW\*(C`AV\*(C'\fR type is a subclass of \fBSV\fR.
.IX Xref "AV (array value) array value (AV) values, array"
.IP awk 4
.IX Item "awk"
Descriptive editing term—short for “awkward”. Also
coincidentally refers to a venerable text-processing language from which
Perl derived some of its high-level ideas.
.IX Xref "awk (editing term)"
.SS B
.IX Subsection "B"
.IP backreference 4
.IX Item "backreference"
A substring \fBcaptured\fR
by a subpattern within unadorned parentheses in a \fBregex\fR. Backslashed
decimal numbers (\f(CW\*(C`\e1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\e2\*(C'\fR, etc.) later in the same pattern refer back to
the corresponding subpattern in the current match. Outside the pattern, the
numbered variables (\f(CW$1\fR, \f(CW$2\fR, etc.) continue to refer to these same
values, as long as the pattern was the last successful match of the current
\&\fBdynamic scope\fR.
.IX Xref "backreferences, about references, backreferences"
.IP backtracking 4
.IX Item "backtracking"
The practice of saying, “If I had to do it all over, I’d do
it differently,” and then actually going back and doing it all over
differently. Mathematically speaking, it’s returning from an unsuccessful
recursion on a tree of possibilities. Perl backtracks when it attempts to
match patterns with a \fBregular expression\fR, and its earlier attempts don’t
pan out. See the section “The Little Engine That /Couldn(n’t)” in Camel
chapter 5, “Pattern Matching”.
.IX Xref "backtracking"
.IP "backward compatibility" 4
.IX Item "backward compatibility"
Means you can still run your old program
because we didn’t break any of the features or bugs it was relying on.
.IX Xref "backward compatibility, defined"
.IP bareword 4
.IX Item "bareword"
A word sufficiently ambiguous to be deemed illegal under
\&\f(CW\*(C`use strict \*(Aqsubs\*(Aq\*(C'\fR. In the absence of that stricture, a bareword is
treated as if quotes were around it.
.IX Xref "barewords, about"
.IP "base class" 4
.IX Item "base class"
A generic \fBobject\fR type; that is, a \fBclass\fR
from which other, more specific classes are derived genetically by
\&\fBinheritance\fR. Also called a
“superclass” by people who respect their ancestors.
.IX Xref "base classes classes, base superclasses classes, superclasses"
.IP big-endian 4
.IX Item "big-endian"
From Swift: someone who
eats eggs big end first. Also used of computers that store the most
significant \fBbyte\fR of a word at a lower byte address than the least
significant byte. Often considered superior to little-endian machines. See
also \fBlittle-endian\fR.
.IX Xref "big–endian, defined endianness, big–endian"
.IP binary 4
.IX Item "binary"
Having to do with numbers represented in base 2. That means
there’s basically two numbers: 0 and 1. Also used to describe a file of
“nontext”, presumably because such a file makes full use of all the binary
bits in its bytes. With the advent of \fBUnicode\fR, this distinction, already
suspect, loses even more of its meaning.
.IX Xref "binary (term)"
.IP "binary operator" 4
.IX Item "binary operator"
An \fBoperator\fR that takes two \fBoperands\fR.
.IX Xref "binary operators, about"
.IP bind 4
.IX Item "bind"
To assign a specific \fBnetwork address\fR to a \fBsocket\fR.
.IX Xref "bind (term)"
.IP bit 4
.IX Item "bit"
An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The smallest
possible unit of information storage. An eighth of a \fBbyte\fR or of a dollar.
(The term “Pieces of Eight” comes from being able to split the old Spanish
dollar into 8 bits, each of which still counted for money. That’s why a 25\-
cent piece today is still “two bits”.)
.IX Xref "bits, defined"
.IP "bit shift" 4
.IX Item "bit shift"
The movement of bits left or right in a
computer word, which has the effect of multiplying or dividing by a
power of 2.
.IX Xref "bit–shift operators, defined"
.IP "bit string" 4
.IX Item "bit string"
A sequence of \fBbits\fR that is actually being thought of as a
sequence of bits, for once.
.IX Xref "bit string"
.IP bless 4
.IX Item "bless"
In corporate life, to grant official
approval to a thing, as in, “The VP of Engineering has blessed our
WebCruncher project.” Similarly, in Perl, to grant official approval to a
\&\fBreferent\fR so that it can function as an \fBobject\fR, such as a WebCruncher
object. See the \f(CW\*(C`bless\*(C'\fR function in Camel chapter 27, “Functions”.
.IX Xref "bless function, about bless (term)"
.IP block 4
.IX Item "block"
What a \fBprocess\fR does when it has to wait for something:
“My process blocked waiting for the disk.” As an unrelated noun, it refers
to a large chunk of data, of a size that the \fBoperating system\fR likes to
deal with (normally a power of 2 such as 512 or 8192). Typically refers to
a chunk of data that’s coming from or going to a disk file.
.IX Xref "blocks, defined"
.IP BLOCK 4
.IX Item "BLOCK"
A syntactic construct
consisting of a sequence of Perl \fBstatements\fR that is delimited by braces.
The \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR statements are defined in terms of \fR\f(CI\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fR\fI\fRs, for
instance. Sometimes we also say “block” to mean a lexical scope; that is, a
sequence of statements that acts like a \fI\fR\f(CI\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fR\fI\fR, such as within an
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR or a file, even though the statements aren’t delimited by braces.
.IX Xref "BLOCK construct, about constructs, BLOCK"
.IP "block buffering" 4
.IX Item "block buffering"
A method of making input and output
efficient by passing one \fBblock\fR at a time. By default, Perl does block
buffering to disk files. See \fBbuffer\fR and \fBcommand buffering\fR.
.IX Xref "block buffering buffering, block"
.IP Boolean 4
.IX Item "Boolean"
A value that is either \fBtrue\fR or
\&\fBfalse\fR.
.IX Xref "Boolean values values, Boolean"
.IP "Boolean context" 4
.IX Item "Boolean context"
A special kind of \fBscalar
context\fR used in conditionals to decide whether the \fBscalar value\fR returned
by an expression is \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR. Does not evaluate as either a
string or a number. See \fBcontext\fR.
.IX Xref "Boolean context, about context, Boolean"
.IP breakpoint 4
.IX Item "breakpoint"
A spot in your program where you’ve told the debugger
to stop \fBexecution\fR so you can poke around and see whether anything is
wrong yet.
.IX Xref "breakpoints, defined"
.IP broadcast 4
.IX Item "broadcast"
To send a \fBdatagram\fR to multiple destinations
simultaneously.
.IX Xref "broadcast (networking term)"
.IP BSD 4
.IX Item "BSD"
A psychoactive drug, popular in the ’80s, probably developed at UC
Berkeley or thereabouts. Similar in many ways to the prescription-only
medication called “System V”, but infinitely more useful. (Or, at least,
more fun.) The full chemical name is “Berkeley Standard Distribution”.
.IX Xref "BSD (Berkeley Standard Distribution) Berkeley Standard Distribution (BSD)"
.IP bucket 4
.IX Item "bucket"
A location in a \fBhash table\fR containing (potentially)
multiple entries whose keys “hash” to the same hash value according to its
hash function. (As internal policy, you don’t have to worry about it unless
you’re into internals, or policy.)
.IX Xref "buckets (term)"
.IP buffer 4
.IX Item "buffer"
A temporary holding location for data. Data that are
\&\fBBlock buffering\fR means that the data is passed on to its destination
whenever the buffer is full. \fBLine buffering\fR means that it’s passed on
whenever a complete line is received. \fBCommand buffering\fR means that it’s
passed every time you do a \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR command (or equivalent). If your output
is unbuffered, the system processes it one byte at a time without the use of
a holding area. This can be rather inefficient.
.IX Xref "buffers, defined"
.IP built-in 4
.IX Item "built-in"
A \fBfunction\fR that is predefined in the
language. Even when hidden by \fBoverriding\fR, you can always get at a built\-
in function by \fBqualifying\fR its name with the \f(CW\*(C`CORE::\*(C'\fR pseudopackage.
.IX Xref "built–in functions, about"
.IP bundle 4
.IX Item "bundle"
A group of related modules on \fBCPAN\fR. (Also sometimes
refers to a group of command-line switches grouped into one \fBswitch
cluster\fR.)
.IX Xref "bundles (term)"
.IP byte 4
.IX Item "byte"
A piece of data worth eight \fBbits\fR in most places.
.IX Xref "bytes (term)"
.IP bytecode 4
.IX Item "bytecode"
A pidgin-like lingo spoken among ’droids when they don’t wish to reveal
their orientation (see \fBendian\fR). Named after some similar languages spoken
(for similar reasons) between compilers and interpreters in the late 20ᵗʰ
century. These languages are characterized by representing everything as a
nonarchitecture-dependent sequence of bytes.
.SS C
.IX Subsection "C"
.IP C 4
.IX Item "C"
A language beloved by many for its inside-out \fBtype\fR
definitions, inscrutable \fBprecedence\fR rules, and heavy \fBoverloading\fR of
the function-call mechanism. (Well, actually, people first switched to C
because they found lowercase identifiers easier to read than upper.) Perl is
written in C, so it’s not surprising that Perl borrowed a few ideas from it.
.IX Xref "C language, about"
.IP cache 4
.IX Item "cache"
A data repository. Instead of computing expensive answers
several times, compute it once and save the result.
.IX Xref "cache (term)"
.IP callback 4
.IX Item "callback"
A \fBhandler\fR that you register with some other part of your
program in the hope that the other part of your program will \fBtrigger\fR your
handler when some event of interest transpires.
.IX Xref "callbacks"
.IP "call by reference" 4
.IX Item "call by reference"
An \fBargument\fR\-passing mechanism in which the \fBformal arguments\fR refer directly to the
\&\fBactual arguments\fR, and the \fBsubroutine\fR can change the actual arguments
by changing the formal arguments. That is, the formal argument is an
\&\fBalias\fR for the actual argument. See also \fBcall by value\fR.
.IX Xref "call by reference references, call by reference mechanism"
.IP "call by value" 4
.IX Item "call by value"
An \fBargument\fR\-passing mechanism in which the \fBformal
arguments\fR refer to a copy of the \fBactual arguments\fR, and the
\&\fBsubroutine\fR cannot change the actual arguments by changing the formal
arguments. See also \fBcall by reference\fR.
.IX Xref "call by value"
.IP canonical 4
.IX Item "canonical"
Reduced to a standard form to facilitate comparison.
.IX Xref "canonical (term)"
.IP "capture variables" 4
.IX Item "capture variables"
The variables—such as \f(CW$1\fR and
\&\f(CW$2\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`%+\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`%– \*(C'\fR—that hold the text remembered in a pattern
match. See Camel chapter 5, “Pattern Matching”.
.IX Xref "capture variables variables, capture"
.IP capturing 4
.IX Item "capturing"
The use of parentheses around a \fBsubpattern\fR in a
\&\fBregular expression\fR to store the matched \fBsubstring\fR as a
\&\fBbackreference\fR. (Captured strings are also returned as a list in \fBlist
context\fR.) See Camel chapter 5, “Pattern Matching”.
.IX Xref "capturing in pattern matching subpatterns, capturing pattern matching, capturing in"
.IP "cargo cult" 4
.IX Item "cargo cult"
Copying and pasting code without understanding it, while
superstitiously believing in its value. This term originated from
preindustrial cultures dealing with the detritus of explorers and colonizers
of technologically advanced cultures. See \fIThe Gods Must Be Crazy\fR.
.IX Xref "cargo cult"
.IP case 4
.IX Item "case"
A property of certain
characters. Originally, typesetter stored capital letters in the upper of
two cases and small letters in the lower one. Unicode recognizes three
cases: \fBlowercase\fR (\fBcharacter property\fR \f(CW\*(C`\ep{lower}\*(C'\fR), \fBtitlecase\fR
(\f(CW\*(C`\ep{title}\*(C'\fR), and \fBuppercase\fR (\f(CW\*(C`\ep{upper}\*(C'\fR). A fourth casemapping called
\&\fBfoldcase\fR is not itself a distinct case, but it is used internally to
implement \fBcasefolding\fR. Not all letters have case, and some nonletters
have case.
.IX Xref "case (character) characters, case considerations"
.IP casefolding 4
.IX Item "casefolding"
Comparing or matching a string case-insensitively. In Perl, it
is implemented with the \f(CW\*(C`/i\*(C'\fR pattern modifier, the \f(CW\*(C`fc\*(C'\fR function, and the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eF\*(C'\fR double-quote translation escape.
.IX Xref "casefolding"
.IP casemapping 4
.IX Item "casemapping"
The process of converting a string to one of the four Unicode

and \f(CW\*(C`uc\*(C'\fR functions.
.IX Xref "casemapping"
.IP character 4
.IX Item "character"

.IP compiler 4
.IX Item "compiler"
Strictly speaking, a program that munches
up another program and spits out yet another file containing the program in
a “more executable” form, typically containing native machine instructions.
The \fIperl\fR program is not a compiler by this definition, but it does
contain a kind of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a more
executable form (\fBsyntax trees\fR) within the \fIperl\fR process itself, which
the \fBinterpreter\fR then interprets. There are, however, extension \fBmodules\fR

.IX Xref "data structures, defined"
.IP "data type" 4
.IX Item "data type"
A set of possible values, together with all the
operations that know how to deal with those values. For example, a numeric
data type has a certain set of numbers that you can work with, as well as
various mathematical operations that you can do on the numbers, but would
make little sense on, say, a string such as \f(CW"Kilroy"\fR. Strings have their
own operations, such as \fBconcatenation\fR. Compound types made of a number of
smaller pieces generally have operations to compose and decompose them, and
perhaps to rearrange them. \fBObjects\fR that model things in the real world
often have operations that correspond to real activities. For instance, if
you model an elevator, your elevator object might have an \f(CW\*(C`open_door\*(C'\fR

.IP DBM 4
.IX Item "DBM"
Stands for “Database Management” routines, a set of routines that emulate an

.IP declaration 4
.IX Item "declaration"
An \fBassertion\fR that states something exists and

.IP declarator 4
.IX Item "declarator"
Something that tells your program what sort of variable

.IX Item "defined"
Having a meaning. Perl thinks that some of the things
people try to do are devoid of meaning; in particular, making use of
variables that have never been given a \fBvalue\fR and performing certain
operations on data that isn’t there. For example, if you try to read data

.IP "fatal error" 4
.IX Item "fatal error"
An uncaught \fBexception\fR, which causes termination of the

A misnamed feature—it should be called,

This always means your main memory, not your disk.
Clouding the issue is the fact that your machine may implement

it really does, and it’ll use disk space to hold inactive bits. This can
make it seem like you have a little more memory than you really do, but
it’s not a substitute for real memory. The best thing that can be said
about virtual memory is that it lets your performance degrade gradually
rather than suddenly when you run out of real memory. But your program
can die when you run out of virtual memory, too—if you haven’t thrashed
your disk to death first.

Something extra that happens when you evaluate an

evaluating a simple assignment statement typically has the “side effect” of
assigning a value to a variable. (And you thought assigning the value was
your primary intent in the first place!) Likewise, assigning a value to the
special variable \f(CW$|\fR (\f(CW$AUTOFLUSH\fR) has the side effect of forcing a

In general, Perl relies on whatever implementation of standard I/O a given

A \fBfunction\fR call directly to the \fBoperating

the distinction. However, if you do happen to know which Perl functions are
really syscalls, you can predict which of these will set the \f(CW$!\fR

confusingly employ the term “system call” to mean what happens when you
call the Perl \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR function, which actually involves many syscalls. To
avoid any confusion, we nearly always say “syscall” for something you could

.IX Xref "uppercase characters characters, uppercase"
.IP "UTF\-8 string" 4
.IX Item "UTF-8 string"
A "string" whose ordinals represent a valid sequence of UTF\-8 bytes.
Sometimes called a "UTF\-8 encoded string".
.Sp
(\fBIMPORTANT:\fR This is unrelated to Perl’s internal
“UTF8 flag”, which only Perl itself
should usually care about. UTF\-8 strings may have that flag set or unset.)
.SS V
.IX Subsection "V"
.IP value 4
.IX Item "value"
An actual piece of data, in contrast to all the
variables, references, keys, indices, operators, and whatnot that you need
to access the value.
.IX Xref "values, defined"
.IP variable 4
.IX Item "variable"
A named storage location that can hold any
of various kinds of \fBvalue\fR, as your program sees fit.
.IX Xref "variables, defined variables"
.IP "variable interpolation" 4
.IX Item "variable interpolation"
The \fBinterpolation\fR of
a scalar or array variable into a string.
.IX Xref "variable interpolation interpolation, variable"
.IP variadic 4
.IX Item "variadic"
Said of a \fBfunction\fR that happily receives an
indeterminate number of \fBactual arguments\fR.
.IX Xref "variadic (term)"
.IP vector 4
.IX Item "vector"
Mathematical jargon for a list of \fBscalar values\fR.
.IX Xref "vectors"
.IP virtual 4
.IX Item "virtual"
Providing the appearance of something without the reality,
as in: virtual memory is not real memory. (See also \fBmemory\fR.) The
opposite of “virtual” is “transparent”, which means providing the reality
of something without the appearance, as in: Perl handles the
variable-length UTF‑8 character encoding transparently.
.IX Xref "virtual (term)"
.IP "void context" 4
.IX Item "void context"
A form of \fBscalar context\fR in which an
\&\fBexpression\fR is not expected to return any \fBvalue\fR at all and is
evaluated for its \fBside effects\fR alone.
.IX Xref "void context context, void"
.IP v\-string 4
.IX Item "v-string"
A “version” or “vector” \fBstring\fR
specified with a \f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR followed by a series of decimal integers in dot
notation, for instance, \f(CW\*(C`v1.20.300.4000\*(C'\fR. Each number turns into a
\&\fBcharacter\fR with the specified ordinal value. (The \f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR is optional when
there are at least three integers.)
.IX Xref "v–strings strings, v–strings"
.SS W
.IX Subsection "W"
.IP warning 4
.IX Item "warning"
A message printed to the \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR stream to the effect that something might be
wrong but isn’t worth blowing up over. See \f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR in Camel chapter 27,
“Functions” and the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma in Camel chapter 28, “Pragmantic
Modules”.

.IP "watch expression" 4
.IX Item "watch expression"
An expression which, when its value
changes, causes a breakpoint in the Perl debugger.
.IX Xref "watch expression expressions, watch"
.IP "weak reference" 4
.IX Item "weak reference"
A reference that doesn’t get counted
normally. When all the normal references to data disappear, the data
disappears. These are useful for circular references that would never
disappear otherwise.
.IX Xref "weak references references, weak"
.IP whitespace 4
.IX Item "whitespace"
A \fBcharacter\fR that moves
your cursor but doesn’t otherwise put anything on your screen. Typically
refers to any of: space, tab, line feed, carriage return, or form feed. In
Unicode, matches many other characters that Unicode considers whitespace,
including the ɴ\-ʙʀ .
.IX Xref "whitespace characters characters, whitespace"
.IP word 4
.IX Item "word"
In normal “computerese”, the piece of data of the size most
efficiently handled by your computer, typically 32 bits or so, give or take a
few powers of 2. In Perl culture, it more often refers to an alphanumeric
\&\fBidentifier\fR (including underscores), or to a string of nonwhitespace
\&\fBcharacters\fR bounded by whitespace or string boundaries.
.IX Xref "words (term)"
.IP "working directory" 4
.IX Item "working directory"
Your current \fBdirectory\fR, from
which relative pathnames are interpreted by the \fBoperating system\fR. The
operating system knows your current directory because you told it with a
\&\f(CW\*(C`chdir\*(C'\fR, or because you started out in the place where your parent
\&\fBprocess\fR was when you were born.
.IX Xref "working directory directories, working"
.IP wrapper 4
.IX Item "wrapper"
A program or subroutine that runs some other program or
subroutine for you, modifying some of its input or output to better suit
your purposes.
.IX Xref "wrappers (term)"
.IP WYSIWYG 4
.IX Item "WYSIWYG"
What You See Is What You Get. Usually used when something
that appears on the screen matches how it will eventually look, like Perl’s
\&\f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR declarations. Also used to mean the opposite of magic because
everything works exactly as it appears, as in the three\- argument form of
\&\f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR.
.IX Xref "WYSIWYG acronym"
.SS X
.IX Subsection "X"
.IP XS 4
.IX Item "XS"
An extraordinarily
exported, expeditiously excellent, expressly eXternal Subroutine, executed
in existing C or C++ or in an exciting extension language called
(exasperatingly) XS.
.IX Xref "XS (eXternal Subroutine) eXternal Subroutine (XS)"

.SS Y
.IX Subsection "Y"
.IP yacc 4

.IP "zero width" 4
.IX Item "zero width"
A subpattern \fBassertion\fR matching the \fBnull
string\fR between \fBcharacters\fR.
.IX Xref "zero–width assertions subpatterns, zero–width assertions assertions (in regexes), zero–width"
.IP zombie 4
.IX Item "zombie"
A process that has died (exited) but
whose parent has not yet received proper notification of its demise by
virtue of having called \f(CW\*(C`wait\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`waitpid\*(C'\fR. If you \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR, you must
clean up after your child processes when they exit; otherwise, the process
table will fill up and your system administrator will Not Be Happy with
you.
