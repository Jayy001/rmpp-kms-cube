perl5282delta \- what is new for perl v5.28.2
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.28.1 release and the 5.28.2
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read
perl5281delta, which describes differences between 5.28.0 and 5.28.1.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another script"
.IX Subsection "Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another script"
There are several sets of digits in the Common script.  \f(CW\*(C`[0\-9]\*(C'\fR is the most
familiar.  But there are also \f(CW\*(C`[\ex{FF10}\-\ex{FF19}]\*(C'\fR (FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO \-
FULLWIDTH DIGIT NINE), and several sets for use in mathematical notation, such
as the MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK DIGITs.  Any of these sets should be able to
appear in script runs of, say, Greek.  But the previous design overlooked all
but the ASCII digits \f(CW\*(C`[0\-9]\*(C'\fR, so the design was flawed.  This has been fixed,
so is both a bug fix and an incompatibility.
.PP
All digits in a run still have to come from the same set of ten digits.

.IX Subsection "Platform-Specific Notes"
.IP Windows 4
.IX Item "Windows"
The Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK build, with its early x64 compiler and
tools, was accidentally broken in Perl 5.27.9.  This has now been fixed.
.IP "Mac OS X" 4
.IX Item "Mac OS X"
Perl's build and testing process on Mac OS X for \f(CW\*(C`\-Duseshrplib\*(C'\fR builds is now
compatible with Mac OS X System Integrity Protection (SIP).
.Sp
SIP prevents binaries in \fI/bin\fR (and a few other places) being passed the
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\*(C'\fR environment variable.  For our purposes this prevents
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\*(C'\fR from being passed to the shell, which prevents that
variable being passed to the testing or build process, so running \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR
couldn't find \fIlibperl.dylib\fR.
.Sp
To work around that, the initial build of the \fIperl\fR executable expects to
find \fIlibperl.dylib\fR in the build directory, and the library path is then
adjusted during installation to point to the installed library.

.SH "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IX Header "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IP \(bu 4
If an in-place edit is still in progress during global destruction and the
process exit code (as stored in \f(CW$?\fR) is zero, perl will now treat the
in-place edit as successful, replacing the input file with any output produced.
.Sp
This allows code like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  perl \-i \-ne \*(Aqprint "Foo"; last\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
to replace the input file, while code like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  perl \-i \-ne \*(Aqprint "Foo"; die\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
will not.  Partly resolves [perl #133659].
.Sp
[GH #16748] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16748>
.IP \(bu 4
A regression in Perl 5.28 caused the following code to fail
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& close(STDIN); open(CHILD, "|wc \-l")\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
because the child's stdin would be closed on exec.  This has now been fixed.
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`pack "u", "invalid uuencoding"\*(C'\fR now properly NUL terminates the zero-length
SV produced.

[GH #16343] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16343>
.IP \(bu 4
Failing to compile a format now aborts compilation.  Like other errors in
sub-parses this could leave the parser in a strange state, possibly crashing
perl if compilation continued.

at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.
.SH "Give Thanks"
