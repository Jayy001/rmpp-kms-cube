.SH NAME
perlivp \- Perl Installation Verification Procedure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBperlivp\fR [\fB\-p\fR] [\fB\-v\fR] [\fB\-h\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBperlivp\fR program is set up at Perl source code build time to test the
Perl version it was built under.  It can be used after running:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    make install
.Ve
.PP
(or your platform's equivalent procedure) to verify that \fBperl\fR and its
libraries have been installed correctly.  A correct installation is verified
by output that looks like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    ok 1
\&    ok 2
.Ve
.PP
etc.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-h\fR help" 5
.IX Item "-h help"
Prints out a brief help message.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR print preface" 5
.IX Item "-p print preface"
Gives a description of each test prior to performing it.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR verbose" 5
.IX Item "-v verbose"
Gives more detailed information about each test, after it has been performed.
Note that any failed tests ought to print out some extra information whether
or not \-v is thrown.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IP \(bu 4
print "# Perl binary '$perlpath' does not appear executable.\en";
.Sp
Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly installed.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.
.IP \(bu 4
print "# Perl version '$]' installed, expected \f(CW$ivp_VERSION\fR.\en";
.Sp
Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly installed.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.
.IP \(bu 4
print "# Perl \e@INC directory '$_' does not appear to exist.\en";
.Sp
Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not properly installed.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.
.IP \(bu 4
print "# Needed module '$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\en";
.Sp
One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not present in the 
installation.  This is a serious error since it adversely affects perlivp's
ability to function.  You may be able to correct this by performing a
proper perl installation.
.IP \(bu 4
print "# Required module '$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\en";
.Sp
An attempt to \f(CW\*(C`eval "require $module"\*(C'\fR failed, even though the list of 
extensions indicated that it should succeed.  Correct by conducting a proper 
installation.
.IP \(bu 4
print "# Unnecessary module 'bLuRfle' appears to be installed.\en";
.Sp
This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have in fact installed 
a bLuRfle.pm module or that the \f(CW\*(C`eval " require \e"$module_name.pm\e"; "\*(C'\fR
test may give misleading results with your installation of perl.  If yours
is the latter case then please let the author know.
.IP \(bu 4
print "# file",+($#missing == 0) ? '' : 's'," missing from installation:\en";
.Sp
One or more files turned up missing according to a run of 
\&\f(CW\*(C`ExtUtils::Installed \-> validate()\*(C'\fR over your installation.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.
.PP
For further information on how to conduct a proper installation consult the 
INSTALL file that comes with the perl source and the README file for your 
platform.
