.SH NAME
perlirix \- Perl version 5 on Irix systems
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes various features of Irix that will affect how Perl
version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.
.SS "Building 32\-bit Perl in Irix"
.IX Subsection "Building 32-bit Perl in Irix"
Use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        sh Configure \-Dcc=\*(Aqcc \-n32\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
to compile Perl 32\-bit.  Don't bother with \-n32 unless you have 7.1
or later compilers (use cc \-version to check).
.PP
(Building 'cc \-n32' is the default.)
.SS "Building 64\-bit Perl in Irix"
.IX Subsection "Building 64-bit Perl in Irix"
Use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        sh Configure \-Dcc=\*(Aqcc \-64\*(Aq \-Duse64bitint
.Ve
.PP
This requires require a 64\-bit MIPS CPU (R8000, R10000, ...)
.PP
You can also use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        sh Configure \-Dcc=\*(Aqcc \-64\*(Aq \-Duse64bitall
.Ve
.PP
but that makes no difference compared with the \-Duse64bitint because
of the \f(CW\*(C`cc \-64\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You can also do
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        sh Configure \-Dcc=\*(Aqcc \-n32\*(Aq \-Duse64bitint
.Ve
.PP
to use long longs for the 64\-bit integer type, in case you don't
have a 64\-bit CPU.
.PP
If you are using gcc, just
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        sh Configure \-Dcc=gcc \-Duse64bitint
.Ve
.PP
should be enough, the Configure should automatically probe for the
correct 64\-bit settings.
.SS "About Compiler Versions of Irix"
.IX Subsection "About Compiler Versions of Irix"
Some Irix cc versions, e.g. 7.3.1.1m (try cc \-version) have been known
to have issues (coredumps) when compiling perl.c.  If you've used
\&\-OPT:fast_io=ON and this happens, try removing it.  If that fails, or
you didn't use that, then try adjusting other optimization options
(\-LNO, \-INLINE, \-O3 to \-O2, et cetera).  The compiler bug has been
reported to SGI.  (Allen Smith <easmith@beatrice.rutgers.edu>)
.SS "Linker Problems in Irix"
.IX Subsection "Linker Problems in Irix"
If you get complaints about so_locations then search in the file
hints/irix_6.sh for "lddflags" and do the suggested adjustments.
(David Billinghurst <David.Billinghurst@riotinto.com.au>)
.SS "Malloc in Irix"
.IX Subsection "Malloc in Irix"
Do not try to use Perl's malloc, this will lead into very mysterious
errors (especially with \-Duse64bitall).
.SS "Building with threads in Irix"
.IX Subsection "Building with threads in Irix"
Run Configure with \-Duseithreads which will configure Perl with
the Perl 5.8.0 "interpreter threads", see threads.
.PP
For Irix 6.2 with perl threads, you have to have the following
patches installed:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        1404 Irix 6.2 Posix 1003.1b man pages
\&        1645 Irix 6.2 & 6.3 POSIX header file updates
\&        2000 Irix 6.2 Posix 1003.1b support modules
\&        2254 Pthread library fixes
\&        2401 6.2 all platform kernel rollup
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBIMPORTANT\fR: Without patch 2401, a kernel bug in Irix 6.2 will cause
your machine to panic and crash when running threaded perl.  Irix 6.3
and later are okay.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    Thanks to Hannu Napari <Hannu.Napari@hut.fi> for the IRIX
\&    pthreads patches information.
.Ve
.SS "Irix 5.3"
.IX Subsection "Irix 5.3"
While running Configure and when building, you are likely to get
quite a few of these warnings:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  ld:
\&  The shared object /usr/lib/libm.so did not resolve any symbols.
\&        You may want to remove it from your link line.
.Ve
.PP
Ignore them: in IRIX 5.3 there is no way to quieten ld about this.
.PP
During compilation you will see this warning from toke.c:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  uopt: Warning: Perl_yylex: this procedure not optimized because it
\&        exceeds size threshold; to optimize this procedure, use \-Olimit
\&        option with value >= 4252.
.Ve
.PP
Ignore the warning.
.PP
In IRIX 5.3 and with Perl 5.8.1 (Perl 5.8.0 didn't compile in IRIX 5.3)
the following failures are known.
.PP

.Ve
.PP
They are suspected to be compiler errors (at least the shuffle.t
failure is known from some IRIX 6 setups) and math library errors
(the Trig.t failure), but since IRIX 5 is long since end-of-lifed,
further fixes for the IRIX are unlikely.  If you can get gcc for 5.3,
you could try that, too, since gcc in IRIX 6 is a known workaround for
at least the shuffle.t and sort.t failures.
