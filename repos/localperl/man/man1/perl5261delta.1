.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.26.0 release and the 5.26.1
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.24.0, first read
perl5260delta, which describes differences between 5.24.0 and 5.26.0.
.SH Security
.IX Header "Security"
.SS "[CVE\-2017\-12837] Heap buffer overflow in regular expression compiler"
.IX Subsection "[CVE-2017-12837] Heap buffer overflow in regular expression compiler"
Compiling certain regular expression patterns with the case-insensitive
modifier could cause a heap buffer overflow and crash perl.  This has now been
fixed.
[GH #16021] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16021>
.SS "[CVE\-2017\-12883] Buffer over-read in regular expression parser"
.IX Subsection "[CVE-2017-12883] Buffer over-read in regular expression parser"
For certain types of syntax error in a regular expression pattern, the error
message could either contain the contents of a random, possibly large, chunk of
memory, or could crash perl.  This has now been fixed.
[GH #16025] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16025>

.IX Subsection "[CVE-2017-12814] $ENV{$key} stack buffer overflow on Windows"
A possible stack buffer overflow in the \f(CW%ENV\fR code on Windows has been fixed
by removing the buffer completely since it was superfluous anyway.

.IP \(bu 4
Several built-in functions previously had bugs that could cause them to write
to the internal stack without allocating room for the item being written.  In
rare situations, this could have led to a crash.  These bugs have now been
fixed, and if any similar bugs are introduced in future, they will be detected
automatically in debugging builds.
[GH #16076] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16076>

Using a symbolic ref with postderef syntax as the key in a hash lookup was

Attempting to apply an attribute to an \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR variable where a function of that

The code that vivifies a typeglob out of a code ref made some false assumptions

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of how to
report the issue.
