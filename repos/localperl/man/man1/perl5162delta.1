perl5162delta \- what is new for perl v5.16.2
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.16.1 release and
the 5.16.2 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read
perl5161delta, which describes differences between 5.16.0 and
5.16.1.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0
If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.
.SH "Modules and Pragmata"
.IX Header "Modules and Pragmata"
.SS "Updated Modules and Pragmata"

.IP \(bu 4
Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 2.70 to version 2.76.
.SH "Configuration and Compilation"

.IP AIX 4
.IX Item "AIX"
Configure now always adds \-qlanglvl=extc99 to the CC flags on AIX when
using xlC.  This will make it easier to compile a number of XS-based modules
that assume C99 [perl #113778].

.PP

.PP
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not
include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.
.PP
For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
please see the \fIAUTHORS\fR file in the Perl source distribution.
.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
send it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure
out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is
supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl
core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
