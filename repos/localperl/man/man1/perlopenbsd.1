.SH NAME
perlopenbsd \- Perl version 5 on OpenBSD systems
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes various features of OpenBSD that will affect how Perl
version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.
.SS "OpenBSD core dumps from getprotobyname_r and getservbyname_r with ithreads"
.IX Subsection "OpenBSD core dumps from getprotobyname_r and getservbyname_r with ithreads"
When Perl is configured to use ithreads, it will use re-entrant library calls
in preference to non-re-entrant versions.  There is an incompatibility in
OpenBSD's \f(CW\*(C`getprotobyname_r\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`getservbyname_r\*(C'\fR function in versions 3.7
and later that will cause a SEGV when called without doing a \f(CW\*(C`bzero\*(C'\fR on
their return structs prior to calling these functions.  Current Perl's
should handle this problem correctly.  Older threaded Perls (5.8.6 or earlier)
will run into this problem.  If you want to run a threaded Perl on OpenBSD
3.7 or higher, you will need to upgrade to at least Perl 5.8.7.
