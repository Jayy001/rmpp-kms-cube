.SH NAME
perl5361delta \- what is new for perl v5.36.1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.36.0 release and the 5.36.1
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.35.0, first read
perl5360delta, which describes differences between 5.35.0 and 5.36.0.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.36.0.  If any exist,
they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
"Reporting Bugs" below.

.IP \(bu 4
Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20220520 to 5.20230423.

\&\f(CW\*(C`Configure\*(C'\fR probed for the return type of \fBmalloc()\fR and \fBfree()\fR by testing
whether declarations for those functions produced a function type mismatch with
the implementation.  On Solaris, with a C++ compiler, this check always failed,
since Solaris instead imports \fBmalloc()\fR and \fBfree()\fR from \f(CW\*(C`std::\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`using\*(C'\fR
for C++ builds.  Since the return types of \fBmalloc()\fR and \fBfree()\fR are well defined
by the C standard, skip probing for them.  \f(CW\*(C`Configure\*(C'\fR command-line arguments
and hints can still override these type in the unlikely case that is needed.

.IX Header "Testing"
Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this
release.
.SH "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IX Header "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IP \(bu 4
An \fBeval()\fR as the last statement in a regex code block could trigger an
interpreter panic; e.g.

[GH #19680 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19680>]
.IP \(bu 4
An \f(CW\*(C`eval EXPR\*(C'\fR referring to a lexical sub defined in grandparent scope no
longer produces an assertion failures.
[GH #19857 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19857>]
.IP \(bu 4
Writing to a magic variables associated with the selected output handle, \f(CW$^\fR,
\&\f(CW$~\fR, \f(CW$=\fR, \f(CW\*(C`$\-\*(C'\fR and \f(CW$%\fR, no longer crashes perl if the IO object has been
cleared from the selected output handle.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of how to
report the issue.
