.SH DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.34.0 release and the 5.36.0
release.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.ie n .SS """use v5.36"""
.el .SS "\f(CWuse v5.36\fP"
.IX Subsection "use v5.36"
As always, \f(CW\*(C`use v5.36\*(C'\fR turns on the feature bundle for that version of Perl.
.PP
The 5.36 bundle enables the \f(CW\*(C`signatures\*(C'\fR feature.  Introduced in Perl version
5.20.0, and modified several times since, the subroutine signatures feature is
now no longer considered experimental. It is now considered a stable language
feature and no longer prints a warning.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use v5.36;
\&
\&    sub add ($x, $y) {
\&      return $x + $y;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Despite this, certain elements of signatured subroutines remain experimental;
see below.
.PP
The 5.36 bundle enables the \f(CW\*(C`isa\*(C'\fR feature.  Introduced in Perl version 5.32.0,
this operator has remained unchanged since then. The operator is now considered
a stable language feature.  For more detail see "Class Instance
Operator" in perlop.
.PP
The 5.36 bundle also \fIdisables\fR the features \f(CW\*(C`indirect\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`multidimensional\*(C'\fR.  These will forbid, respectively: the use of "indirect"
method calls (like \f(CW\*(C`$x = new Class;\*(C'\fR); the use of a list expression as a hash
key to simulate sparse multidimensional arrays.  The specifics of these changes
can be found in feature, but the short version is: this is a bit like having
more \f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR turned on, disabling features that cause more trouble than
they're worth.
.PP
Furthermore, \f(CW\*(C`use v5.36\*(C'\fR will also enable warnings as if you'd written \f(CW\*(C`use
warnings\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Finally, with this release, the experimental \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR feature, present in
every feature bundle since they were introduced in v5.10, has been removed from
the v5.36 bundle.  If you want to use it (against our advice), you'll have to
enable it explicitly.
.SS "\-g command-line flag"
.IX Subsection "-g command-line flag"
A new command-line flag, \-g, is available. It is a simpler alias for \-0777.
.PP
For more information, see "\-g" in perlrun.
.SS "Unicode 14.0 is supported"
.IX Subsection "Unicode 14.0 is supported"
See <https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/> for details.
.SS "regex sets are no longer considered experimental"
.IX Subsection "regex sets are no longer considered experimental"
Prior to this release, the regex sets feature (officially named
"Extended Bracketed Character Classes") was considered experimental.
Introduced in Perl version 5.18.0, and modified several times since,
this is now considered a stable language feature and its use no longer
prints a warning.  See "Extended Bracketed Character
Classes" in perlrecharclass.
.SS "Variable length lookbehind is mostly no longer considered experimental"
.IX Subsection "Variable length lookbehind is mostly no longer considered experimental"
Prior to this release, any form of variable length lookbehind was
considered experimental. With this release the experimental status has
been reduced to cover only lookbehind that contains capturing parenthesis.
This is because it is not clear if
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    "aaz"=~/(?=z)(?<=(a|aa))/
.Ve
.PP
should match and leave \f(CW$1\fR equaling "a" or "aa". Currently it will match
the longest possible alternative, "aa". While we are confident that the overall
construct will now match only when it should, we are not confident that we
will keep the current "longest match" behavior.
.SS "SIGFPE no longer deferred"
.IX Subsection "SIGFPE no longer deferred"
Floating-point exceptions are now delivered immediately, in the same way
as other "fault"\-like signals such as SIGSEGV. This means one has at
least a chance to catch such a signal with a \f(CW$SIG{FPE}\fR handler, e.g.
so that \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR can report the line in perl that triggered it.
.SS "Stable boolean tracking"
.IX Subsection "Stable boolean tracking"
The "true" and "false" boolean values, often accessed by constructions like
\&\f(CW\*(C`!!0\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`!!1\*(C'\fR, as well as being returned from many core functions and
operators, now remember their boolean nature even through assignment into
variables. The new function \f(CWis_bool()\fR in builtin can check whether
a value has boolean nature.
.PP
This is likely to be useful when interoperating with other languages or
data-type serialisation, among other places.
.SS "iterating over multiple values at a time (experimental)"
.IX Subsection "iterating over multiple values at a time (experimental)"
You can now iterate over multiple values at a time by specifying a list of
lexicals within parentheses. For example,
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    for my ($key, $value) (%hash) { ... }
\&    for my ($left, $right, $gripping) (@moties) { ... }
.Ve
.PP
Prior to perl v5.36, attempting to specify a list after \f(CW\*(C`for my\*(C'\fR was a syntax
error.
.PP
This feature is currently experimental and will cause a warning of category
\&\f(CW\*(C`experimental::for_list\*(C'\fR.  For more detail see "Compound Statements" in perlsyn.
See also "builtin::indexed" in this document, which is a handy companion to
n\-at-a-time foreach.
.SS "builtin functions (experimental)"
.IX Subsection "builtin functions (experimental)"
A new core module builtin has been added, which provides documentation for
new always-present functions that are built into the interpreter.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    say "Reference type of arrays is ", builtin::reftype([]);
.Ve
.PP
It also provides a lexical import mechanism for providing short name versions
of these functions.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use builtin \*(Aqreftype\*(Aq;
\&    say "Reference type of arrays is ", reftype([]);
.Ve
.PP
This builtin function mechanism and the functions it provides are all
currently \fBexperimental\fR.  We expect that \f(CW\*(C`builtin\*(C'\fR itself will cease to be
experimental in the near future, but that individual functions in it may become
stable on an ongoing basis.  Other functions will be added to \f(CW\*(C`builtin\*(C'\fR over
time.
.PP
For details, see builtin, but here's a summary of builtin functions in
v5.36:
.IP builtin::trim 4
.IX Item "builtin::trim"
This function treats its argument as a string, returning the result of removing
all white space at its beginning and ending.
.IP builtin::indexed 4
.IX Item "builtin::indexed"
This function returns a list twice as big as its argument list, where each item
is preceded by its index within that list. This is primarily useful for using
the new \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR syntax with multiple iterator variables to iterate over an
array or list, while also tracking the index of each item:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use builtin \*(Aqindexed\*(Aq;
\&
\&    foreach my ($index, $val) (indexed @array) {
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "builtin::true, builtin::false, builtin::is_bool" 4
.IX Item "builtin::true, builtin::false, builtin::is_bool"
\&\f(CW\*(C`true\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR return boolean true and false values.  Perl is still perl,
and doesn't have strict typing of booleans, but these values will be known to
have been created as booleans.  \f(CW\*(C`is_bool\*(C'\fR will tell you whether a value was
known to have been created as a boolean.
.IP "builtin::weaken, builtin::unweaken, builtin::is_weak" 4
.IX Item "builtin::weaken, builtin::unweaken, builtin::is_weak"
These functions will, respectively: weaken a reference; strengthen a reference;
and return whether a reference is weak.  (A weak reference is not counted for
garbage collection purposes.  See perlref.)  These can take the place of
some similar routines in Scalar::Util.
.IP "builtin::blessed, builtin::refaddr, builtin::reftype" 4
.IX Item "builtin::blessed, builtin::refaddr, builtin::reftype"
These functions provide more data about references (or non-references,
actually!) and can take the place of similar routines found in Scalar::Util.
.IP "builtin::ceil, builtin::floor" 4
.IX Item "builtin::ceil, builtin::floor"
\&\f(CW\*(C`ceil\*(C'\fR returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to its argument.
\&\f(CW\*(C`floor\*(C'\fR returns the largest integer less than or equal to its argument.  These
can take the place of similar routines found in POSIX.
.ie n .SS """defer"" blocks (experimental)"
.el .SS "\f(CWdefer\fP blocks (experimental)"
.IX Subsection "defer blocks (experimental)"
This release adds support for \f(CW\*(C`defer\*(C'\fR blocks, which are blocks of code
prefixed by the \f(CW\*(C`defer\*(C'\fR modifier. They provide a section of code which runs
at a later time, during scope exit.
.PP
In brief, when a \f(CW\*(C`defer\*(C'\fR block is reached at runtime, its body is set aside to
be run when the enclosing scope is exited.  It is unlike a UNITCHECK (among
other reasons) in that if the block \fIcontaining\fR the \f(CW\*(C`defer\*(C'\fR block is exited
before the block is reached, it will not be run.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`defer\*(C'\fR blocks can be used to take the place of "scope guard" objects where an
object is passed a code block to be run by its destructor.
.PP
For more information, see "defer blocks" in perlsyn.
.ie n .SS "try/catch can now have a ""finally"" block (experimental)"
.el .SS "try/catch can now have a \f(CWfinally\fP block (experimental)"
.IX Subsection "try/catch can now have a finally block (experimental)"
The experimental \f(CW\*(C`try\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR syntax has been extended to support an
optional third block introduced by the \f(CW\*(C`finally\*(C'\fR keyword.
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    try {
\&        attempt();
\&        print "Success\en";
\&    }
\&    catch ($e) {
\&        print "Failure\en";
\&    }
\&    finally {
\&        print "This happens regardless\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
This provides code which runs at the end of the \f(CW\*(C`try\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR construct,
even if aborted by an exception or control-flow keyword. They are similar
to \f(CW\*(C`defer\*(C'\fR blocks.
.PP
For more information, see "Try Catch Exception Handling" in perlsyn.
.SS "non-ASCII delimiters for quote-like operators (experimental)"
.IX Subsection "non-ASCII delimiters for quote-like operators (experimental)"
Perl traditionally has allowed just four pairs of string/pattern
delimiters: \f(CW\*(C`(\ )\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`{\ }\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`[\ ]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`<\ >\*(C'\fR, all in the
ASCII range.  Unicode has hundreds more possibilities, and using this
feature enables many of them.  When enabled, you can say \f(CW\*(C`qr«\ »\*(C'\fR for
example, or \f(CW\*(C`use\ utf8;\ q𝄃string𝄂\*(C'\fR.  See "The
\&'extra_paired_delimiters' feature" in feature for details.
.ie n .SS "@_ is now experimental within signatured subs"
.el .SS "\f(CW@_\fP is now experimental within signatured subs"
.IX Subsection "@_ is now experimental within signatured subs"
Even though subroutine signatures are now stable, use of the legacy arguments
array (\f(CW@_\fR) with a subroutine that has a signature \fIremains\fR experimental,
with its own warning category.  Silencing the \f(CW\*(C`experimental::signatures\*(C'\fR
warning category is not sufficient to dismiss this.  The new warning is emitted
with the category name \f(CW\*(C`experimental::args_array_with_signatures\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Any subroutine that has a signature and tries to make use of the defaults
argument array or an element thereof (\f(CW@_\fR or \f(CW$_[INDEX]\fR), either
explicitly or implicitly (such as \f(CW\*(C`shift\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`pop\*(C'\fR with no argument) will
provoke a warning at compile-time:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use v5.36;
\&
\&    sub f ($x, $y = 123) {
\&      say "The first argument is $_[0]";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP

.PP
.Vb 2
\&    Use of @_ in array element with signatured subroutine is experimental
\&    at file.pl line 4.
.Ve
.PP
The behaviour of code which attempts to do this is no longer specified, and
may be subject to change in a future version.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "A physically empty sort is now a compile-time error"
.IX Subsection "A physically empty sort is now a compile-time error"
.Vb 3
\&    @a = sort @empty; # unaffected
\&    @a = sort;        # now a compile\-time error
\&    @a = sort ();     # also a compile\-time error
.Ve
.PP
A bare sort used to be a weird way to create an empty list; now it croaks
at compile time. This change is intended to free up some of the syntax space
for possible future enhancements to \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR.
.SH Deprecations
.IX Header "Deprecations"
.ie n .SS """use VERSION"" (where VERSION is below v5.11) after ""use v5.11"" is deprecated"
.el .SS "\f(CWuse VERSION\fP (where VERSION is below v5.11) after \f(CWuse v5.11\fP is deprecated"
.IX Subsection "use VERSION (where VERSION is below v5.11) after use v5.11 is deprecated"
When in the scope of \f(CW\*(C`use v5.11\*(C'\fR or later, a \f(CW\*(C`use vX\*(C'\fR line where \fIX\fR is
lower than v5.11 will now issue a warning:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Downgrading a use VERSION declaration to below v5.11 is deprecated
.Ve
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    use v5.14;
\&    say "The say statement is permitted";
\&    use v5.8;                               # This will print a warning
\&    print "We must use print\en";
.Ve
.PP
This is because the Perl team plans to change the behavior in this case.  Since
Perl v5.12 (and parts of v5.11), strict is enabled \fIunless it had previously
been disabled\fR.  In other words:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    no strict;
\&    use v5.12;  # will not enable strict, because "no strict" preceded it
\&    $x = 1;     # permitted, despite no "my" declaration
.Ve
.PP
In the future, this behavior will be eliminated and \f(CW\*(C`use VERSION\*(C'\fR will
\&\fIalways\fR enable strict for versions v5.12 and later.
.PP
Code which wishes to mix versions in this manner should use lexical scoping
with block syntax to ensure that the differently versioned regions remain
lexically isolated.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    {
\&        use v5.14;
\&        say "The say statement is permitted";
\&    }
\&
\&    {
\&        use v5.8;                           # No warning is emitted
\&        print "We must use print\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Of course, this is probably not something you ever need to do!  If the first
block compiles, it means you're using perl v5.14.0 or later.

.IP \(bu 4
We now probe for compiler support for C11 thread local storage, and where
available use this for "implicit context" for XS extensions making API calls for
a threaded Perl build.  This requires fewer function calls at the C level than
POSIX thread specific storage. We continue to use the pthreads approach if
the C11 approach is not available.

Perl can now be configured to no longer allocate keys for large hashes
from the shared string table.

Objects (by default)
.IP \(bu 4
Associative arrays
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The shared string table was originally added to improve performance for blessed
hashes used as objects, because every object instance has the same keys, so it
is an optimisation to share memory between them. It also makes sense for symbol
tables, where derived classes will have the same keys (typically method names),
and the OP trees built for method calls can also share memory. The shared
string table behaves roughly like a cache for hash keys.
.Sp
But for hashes actually used as associative arrays \- mapping keys to values \-
typically the keys are not re-used in other hashes. For example, "seen" hashes
are keyed by object IDs (or addresses), and logically these keys won't repeat
in other hashes.
.Sp
Storing these "used just once" keys in the shared string table increases CPU
and RAM use for no gain. For such keys the shared string table behaves as a
cache with a 0% hit rate. Storing all the keys there increases the total size
of the shared string table, as well as increasing the number of times it is
resized as it grows. \fBWorse\fR \- in any environment that has "copy on write"
memory for child process (such as a pre-forking server), the memory pages used
for the shared string table rapidly need to be copied as the child process
manipulates hashes. Hence if most of the shared string table is such that keys
are used only in one place, there is no benefit from re-use within the perl
interpreter, but a high cost due to more pages for the OS to copy.
.Sp
The perl interpreter can now be Configured to disable shared hash keys
for "large" hashes (that are neither objects nor symbol tables).  To do
so, add \f(CW\*(C`\-Accflags=\*(Aq\-DPERL_USE_UNSHARED_KEYS_IN_LARGE_HASHES\*(Aq\*(C'\fR to
your \fIConfigure\fR options.  "Large" is a heuristic \-\- currently the
heuristic is that sharing is disabled when adding a key to a hash
triggers allocation of more storage, and the hash has more than 42 keys.
.Sp
This \fBmight\fR cause slightly increased memory usage for programs that create
(unblessed) data structures that contain multiple large hashes that share the
same keys. But generally our testing suggests that for the specific cases
described it is a win, and other code is unaffected.

.IP \(bu 4
The Perl C source code now uses some C99 features, which we have verified are
supported by all compilers we target. This means that Perl's headers now
contain some code that is legal in C99 but not C89.
.Sp
This may cause problems for some XS modules that unconditionally add
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-Werror=declaration\-after\-statement\*(C'\fR to their C compiler flags if compiling
with gcc or clang. Earlier versions of Perl support long obsolete compilers
that are strict in rejecting certain C99 features, particularly mixed
declarations and code, and hence it makes sense for XS module authors to audit
that their code does not violate this. However, doing this is now only
possible on these earlier versions of Perl, hence these modules need to be
changed to only add this flag for \f(CW\*(C`$] < 5.035005\*(C'\fR.

.IX Item "keys %ENV on VMS returns consistent results"
On VMS entries in the \f(CW%ENV\fR hash are loaded from the OS environment on
first access, hence the first iteration of \f(CW%ENV\fR requires the entire
environment to be scanned to find all possible keys. This initialisation had
always been done correctly for full iteration, but previously was not
happening for \f(CW%ENV\fR in scalar context, meaning that \f(CW\*(C`scalar %ENV\*(C'\fR would
return 0 if called before any other \f(CW%ENV\fR access, or would only return the
count of keys accessed if there had been no iteration.
.Sp
These bugs are now fixed \- \f(CW%ENV\fR and \f(CW\*(C`keys %ENV\*(C'\fR in scalar context now
return the correct result \- the count of all keys in the environment.

These changes also provide the base support to be able to provide ASCII

The API constant formerly named \f(CW\*(C`G_ARRAY\*(C'\fR, indicating list context, has now

This inconsistency is now fixed \- the internal state is now freed immediately by
\&\f(CW\*(C`untie\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
As the precise timing of this behaviour can be observed with pure Perl code
(the timing of \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR on objects returned from \f(CW\*(C`FIRSTKEY\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`NEXTKEY\*(C'\fR)
it's just possible that some code is sensitive to it.

Setting a breakpoint on a BEGIN or equivalently a \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR statement
