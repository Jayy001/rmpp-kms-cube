.SH NAME
perl5362delta \- what is new for perl v5.36.2
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.36.1 release and the 5.36.2
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.36.0, first read
perl5361delta, which describes differences between 5.36.0 and 5.36.1.
.SH Security
.IX Header "Security"
This release fixes the following security issues.
.SS "CVE\-2023\-47038 \- Write past buffer end via illegal user-defined Unicode property"
.IX Subsection "CVE-2023-47038 - Write past buffer end via illegal user-defined Unicode property"
This vulnerability was reported directly to the Perl security team by
Nathan Mills \f(CW\*(C`the.true.nathan.mills@gmail.com\*(C'\fR.
.PP
A crafted regular expression when compiled by perl 5.30.0 through
5.38.0 can cause a one-byte attacker controlled buffer overflow in a
heap allocated buffer.
.SS "CVE\-2023\-47039 \- Perl for Windows binary hijacking vulnerability"
.IX Subsection "CVE-2023-47039 - Perl for Windows binary hijacking vulnerability"
This vulnerability was reported to the Intel Product Security Incident
Response Team (PSIRT) by GitHub user ycdxsb
<https://github.com/ycdxsb/WindowsPrivilegeEscalation>. PSIRT then
reported it to the Perl security team.
.PP
Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to
find the shell (\f(CW\*(C`cmd.exe\*(C'\fR). When running an executable which uses
Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute \f(CW\*(C`cmd.exe\*(C'\fR
within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues,
Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory.
.PP
An attacker with limited privileges can exploit this behavior by
placing \f(CW\*(C`cmd.exe\*(C'\fR in locations with weak permissions, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`C:\eProgramData\*(C'\fR. By doing so, when an administrator attempts to use
this executable from these compromised locations, arbitrary code can
be executed.
.SH Acknowledgements

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.
