.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
There are many books on Perl and Perl-related. A few of these are
good, some are OK, but many aren't worth your money. There is a list
of these books, some with extensive reviews, at
<https://www.perl.org/books/library.html> . We list some of the books here, and while
listing a book implies our
endorsement, don't think that not including a book means anything.
.PP
Most of these books are available online through O'Reilly Online Learning
( <https://www.oreilly.com> ).

.IX Subsection "A note on freshness"
Each version of Perl comes with the documentation that was current at
the time of release. This poses a problem for content such as book
lists. There are probably very nice books published after this list
was included in your Perl release, and you can check the latest
released version at <https://perldoc.perl.org/perlbook.html> .
.PP
Some of the books we've listed appear almost ancient in internet
scale, but we've included those books because they still describe the
current way of doing things. Not everything in Perl changes every day.
Many of the beginner-level books, too, go over basic features and
techniques that are still valid today. In general though, we try to
limit this list to books published in the past five years.
.SS "Get your book listed"
