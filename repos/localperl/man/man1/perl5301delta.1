.SH NAME
perl5301delta \- what is new for perl v5.30.1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.30.0 release and the 5.30.1
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read
perl5300delta, which describes differences between 5.28.0 and 5.30.0.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.30.1.  If any exist,
they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
"Reporting Bugs" below.
.SH "Modules and Pragmata"
.IX Header "Modules and Pragmata"
.SS "Updated Modules and Pragmata"

.IP \(bu 4
Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20190522 to 5.20191110.
.SH Documentation
.IX Header "Documentation"
.SS "Changes to Existing Documentation"
.IX Subsection "Changes to Existing Documentation"
We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes listed in
this document.  If you find any we have missed, send email to
perlbug@perl.org <mailto:perlbug@perl.org>.
.PP
Additionally, documentation has been updated to reference GitHub as the new
canonical repository and to describe the new GitHub pull request workflow.
.SH "Configuration and Compilation"
.IX Header "Configuration and Compilation"
.IP \(bu 4
The \f(CW\*(C`ECHO\*(C'\fR macro is now defined.  This is used in a \f(CW\*(C`dtrace\*(C'\fR rule that was
originally changed for FreeBSD, and the FreeBSD make apparently predefines it.
The Solaris make does not predefine \f(CW\*(C`ECHO\*(C'\fR which broke this rule on Solaris.

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this
release.

.IP Win32 4
.IX Item "Win32"
The locale tests could crash on Win32 due to a Windows bug, and separately due
to the CRT throwing an exception if the locale name wasn't validly encoded in
the current code page.
.Sp
For the second we now decode the locale name ourselves, and always decode it as
UTF\-8.

.IP \(bu 4
Setting \f(CW$)\fR now properly sets supplementary group ids, if you have the
necessary privileges.
[perl #17031] <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/17031>
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`readline @foo\*(C'\fR now evaluates \f(CW@foo\fR in scalar context.  Previously, it would
be evaluated in list context, and since \fBreadline()\fR pops only one argument from
the stack, the stack could underflow, or be left with unexpected values on it.
[perl #16929] <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16929>
.IP \(bu 4
\&\fBsv_gets()\fR now recovers better if the target SV is modified by a signal handler.
[perl #16960] <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16960>
.IP \(bu 4
Matching a non\-\f(CW\*(C`SVf_UTF8\*(C'\fR string against a regular expression containing
Unicode literals could leak an SV on each match attempt.
[perl #17140] <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/17140>
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`sprintf("%.*a", \-10000, $x)\*(C'\fR would cause a buffer overflow due to
mishandling of the negative precision value.
[perl #16942] <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16942>
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CWscalar()\fR on a reference could cause an erroneous assertion failure during
compilation.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history.  In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at
<https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of how to
report the issue.
.SH "Give Thanks"
.IX Header "Give Thanks"
If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you
can do so by running the \f(CW\*(C`perlthanks\*(C'\fR program:
