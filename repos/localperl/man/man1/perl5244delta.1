A crafted regular expression could cause a heap buffer write overflow, with
control over the bytes written.
[GH #16185] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16185>

.IX Subsection "[CVE-2018-6798] Heap-buffer-overflow in Perl__byte_dump_string (utf8.c)"
Matching a crafted locale dependent regular expression could cause a heap
buffer read overflow and potentially information disclosure.

The \f(CWreadpipe()\fR built-in function now checks at compile time that it has only
one parameter expression, and puts it in scalar context, thus ensuring that it
doesn't corrupt the stack at runtime.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.
