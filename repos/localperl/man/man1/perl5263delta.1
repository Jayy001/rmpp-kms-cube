.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.26.2 release and the 5.26.3
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.1, first read
perl5262delta, which describes differences between 5.26.1 and 5.26.2.
.SH Security
.IX Header "Security"
.SS "[CVE\-2018\-12015] Directory traversal in module Archive::Tar"
.IX Subsection "[CVE-2018-12015] Directory traversal in module Archive::Tar"
By default, Archive::Tar doesn't allow extracting files outside the current
working directory.  However, this secure extraction mode could be bypassed by
putting a symlink and a regular file with the same name into the tar file.

.SS "[CVE\-2018\-18311] Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow and segmentation fault"
.IX Subsection "[CVE-2018-18311] Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow and segmentation fault"
Integer arithmetic in \f(CWPerl_my_setenv()\fR could wrap when the combined length
of the environment variable name and value exceeded around 0x7fffffff.  This
could lead to writing beyond the end of an allocated buffer with attacker
supplied data.

.IP \(bu 4
Unexpected ']' with no following ')' in (?[... in regex; marked by <\-\- HERE in m/%s/
.Sp
(F) While parsing an extended character class a ']' character was encountered
at a point in the definition where the only legal use of ']' is to close the
character class definition as part of a '])', you may have forgotten the close
paren, or otherwise confused the parser.
.IP \(bu 4
Expecting close paren for nested extended charclass in regex; marked by <\-\- HERE in m/%s/
.Sp
(F) While parsing a nested extended character class like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    (?[ ... (?flags:(?[ ... ])) ... ])
\&                             ^
.Ve
.Sp
we expected to see a close paren ')' (marked by ^) but did not.
.IP \(bu 4
Expecting close paren for wrapper for nested extended charclass in regex; marked by <\-\- HERE in m/%s/
.Sp
(F) While parsing a nested extended character class like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    (?[ ... (?flags:(?[ ... ])) ... ])
\&                              ^

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history.  In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.
.SH "Give Thanks"
.IX Header "Give Thanks"
If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the \f(CW\*(C`perlthanks\*(C'\fR program:
