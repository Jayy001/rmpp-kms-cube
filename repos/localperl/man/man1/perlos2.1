.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.SS Target
.IX Subsection "Target"
The target is to make OS/2 one of the best supported platform for
using/building/developing Perl and \fIPerl applications\fR, as well as
make Perl the best language to use under OS/2. The secondary target is
to try to make this work under DOS and Win* as well (but not \fBtoo\fR hard).
.PP
The current state is quite close to this target. Known limitations:
.IP \(bu 5
Some *nix programs use \fBfork()\fR a lot; with the mostly useful flavors of
perl for OS/2 (there are several built simultaneously) this is
supported; but some flavors do not support this (e.g., when Perl is
called from inside REXX).  Using \fBfork()\fR after
\&\fIuse\fRing dynamically loading extensions would not work with \fIvery\fR old
versions of EMX.
.IP \(bu 5
You need a separate perl executable \fIperl_\|_.exe\fR (see "perl_\|_.exe")
if you want to use PM code in your application (as Perl/Tk or OpenGL
Perl modules do) without having a text-mode window present.
.Sp
While using the standard \fIperl.exe\fR from a text-mode window is possible
too, I have seen cases when this causes degradation of the system stability.
Using \fIperl_\|_.exe\fR avoids such a degradation.
.IP \(bu 5
There is no simple way to access WPS objects. The only way I know
is via \f(CW\*(C`OS2::REXX\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SOM\*(C'\fR extensions (see OS2::REXX, SOM).
However, we do not have access to
convenience methods of Object-REXX. (Is it possible at all? I know
of no Object-REXX API.)  The \f(CW\*(C`SOM\*(C'\fR extension (currently in alpha-text)
may eventually remove this shortcoming; however, due to the fact that
DII is not supported by the \f(CW\*(C`SOM\*(C'\fR module, using \f(CW\*(C`SOM\*(C'\fR is not as
convenient as one would like it.
.PP
Please keep this list up-to-date by informing me about other items.
.SS "Other OSes"
.IX Subsection "Other OSes"
Since OS/2 port of perl uses a remarkable EMX environment, it can
run (and build extensions, and \- possibly \- be built itself) under any
environment which can run EMX. The current list is DOS,
DOS\-inside\-OS/2, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT. Out of many perl flavors,
only one works, see "\fIperl_.exe\fR".
.PP
Note that not all features of Perl are available under these
environments. This depends on the features the \fIextender\fR \- most
probably RSX \- decided to implement.
.PP
Cf. "Prerequisites".
.SS Prerequisites
.IX Subsection "Prerequisites"
.IP EMX 6
.IX Item "EMX"
EMX runtime is required (may be substituted by RSX). Note that
it is possible to make \fIperl_.exe\fR to run under DOS without any
external support by binding \fIemx.exe\fR/\fIrsx.exe\fR to it, see \fBemxbind\fR\|(1).
Note that under DOS for best results one should use RSX runtime, which
has much more functions working (like \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`popen\*(C'\fR and so on). In
fact RSX is required if there is no VCPI present. Note the
RSX requires DPMI.  Many implementations of DPMI are known to be very
buggy, beware!
.Sp
Only the latest runtime is supported, currently \f(CW\*(C`0.9d fix 03\*(C'\fR. Perl may run
under earlier versions of EMX, but this is not tested.
.Sp
One can get different parts of EMX from, say
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  ftp://crydee.sai.msu.ru/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/emx+gcc/
\&  http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h\-browse.php?dir=/pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9d/
.Ve
.Sp
The runtime component should have the name \fIemxrt.zip\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBNOTE\fR. When using \fIemx.exe\fR/\fIrsx.exe\fR, it is enough to have them on your path. One
does not need to specify them explicitly (though this
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  emx perl_.exe \-de 0
.Ve
.Sp
will work as well.)
.IP RSX 6
.IX Item "RSX"
To run Perl on DPMI platforms one needs RSX runtime. This is
needed under DOS\-inside\-OS/2, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT (see 
"Other OSes"). RSX would not work with VCPI
only, as EMX would, it requires DMPI.
.Sp
Having RSX and the latest \fIsh.exe\fR one gets a fully functional
\&\fB*nix\fR\-ish environment under DOS, say, \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\`\`\fR and
pipe\-\f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR work. In fact, MakeMaker works (for static build), so one
can have Perl development environment under DOS.
.Sp
One can get RSX from, say
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  http://cd.textfiles.com/hobbesos29804/disk1/EMX09C/

\&  http://www.ilyaz.org/software/os2/
.Ve
.Sp
as \fIsh_dos.zip\fR or under similar names starting with \f(CW\*(C`sh\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pdksh\*(C'\fR etc.
.IP HPFS 6
.IX Item "HPFS"
Perl does not care about file systems, but the perl library contains
many files with long names, so to install it intact one needs a file
system which supports long file names.
.Sp
Note that if you do not plan to build the perl itself, it may be
possible to fool EMX to truncate file names. This is not supported,
read EMX docs to see how to do it.
.IP pdksh 6
.IX Item "pdksh"
To start external programs with complicated command lines (like with
pipes in between, and/or quoting of arguments), Perl uses an external
shell. With EMX port such shell should be named \fIsh.exe\fR, and located
either in the wired-in-during-compile locations (usually \fIF:/bin\fR),
or in configurable location (see "\f(CW\*(C`PERL_SH_DIR\*(C'\fR").
.Sp
For best results use EMX pdksh. The standard binary (5.2.14 or later) runs
under DOS (with "RSX") as well, see
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  http://www.ilyaz.org/software/os2/
.Ve
.SS "Starting Perl programs under OS/2 (and DOS and...)"
.IX Subsection "Starting Perl programs under OS/2 (and DOS and...)"
Start your Perl program \fIfoo.pl\fR with arguments \f(CW\*(C`arg1 arg2 arg3\*(C'\fR the
same way as on any other platform, by
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        perl foo.pl arg1 arg2 arg3
.Ve
.PP
If you want to specify perl options \f(CW\*(C`\-my_opts\*(C'\fR to the perl itself (as
opposed to your program), use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        perl \-my_opts foo.pl arg1 arg2 arg3
.Ve
.PP
Alternately, if you use OS/2\-ish shell, like CMD or 4os2, put
the following at the start of your perl script:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        extproc perl \-S \-my_opts
.Ve
.PP
rename your program to \fIfoo.cmd\fR, and start it by typing
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        foo arg1 arg2 arg3
.Ve
.PP
Note that because of stupid OS/2 limitations the full path of the perl
script is not available when you use \f(CW\*(C`extproc\*(C'\fR, thus you are forced to
use \f(CW\*(C`\-S\*(C'\fR perl switch, and your script should be on the \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR. As a plus
side, if you know a full path to your script, you may still start it
with
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        perl ../../blah/foo.cmd arg1 arg2 arg3
.Ve
.PP
(note that the argument \f(CW\*(C`\-my_opts\*(C'\fR is taken care of by the \f(CW\*(C`extproc\*(C'\fR line
in your script, see \f(CW"extproc"\fR on the first line).
.PP
To understand what the above \fImagic\fR does, read perl docs about \f(CW\*(C`\-S\*(C'\fR
switch \- see perlrun, and cmdref about \f(CW\*(C`extproc\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        view perl perlrun
\&        man perlrun
\&        view cmdref extproc
\&        help extproc
.Ve
.PP
or whatever method you prefer.
.PP
There are also endless possibilities to use \fIexecutable extensions\fR of
4os2, \fIassociations\fR of WPS and so on... However, if you use
*nixish shell (like \fIsh.exe\fR supplied in the binary distribution),
you need to follow the syntax specified in "Command Switches" in perlrun.
.PP
Note that \fB\-S\fR switch supports scripts with additional extensions 
\&\fI.cmd\fR, \fI.btm\fR, \fI.bat\fR, \fI.pl\fR as well.
.SS "Starting OS/2 (and DOS) programs under Perl"
.IX Subsection "Starting OS/2 (and DOS) programs under Perl"
This is what \fBsystem()\fR (see "system" in perlfunc), \f(CW\`\`\fR (see
"I/O Operators" in perlop), and \fIopen pipe\fR (see "open" in perlfunc)
are for. (Avoid \fBexec()\fR (see "exec" in perlfunc) unless you know what you
do).
.PP
Note however that to use some of these operators you need to have a
sh-syntax shell installed (see "Pdksh", 
"Frequently asked questions"), and perl should be able to find it
(see "\f(CW\*(C`PERL_SH_DIR\*(C'\fR").
.PP
The cases when the shell is used are:
.IP 1. 4
One-argument \fBsystem()\fR (see "system" in perlfunc), \fBexec()\fR (see "exec" in perlfunc)
with redirection or shell meta-characters;
.IP 2. 4
Pipe-open (see "open" in perlfunc) with the command which contains redirection 
or shell meta-characters;
.IP 3. 4
Backticks \f(CW\`\`\fR (see "I/O Operators" in perlop) with the command which contains
redirection or shell meta-characters;
.IP 4. 4
If the executable called by \fBsystem()\fR/\fBexec()\fR/pipe\-\fBopen()\fR/\f(CW\`\`\fR is a script
with the "magic" \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR line or \f(CW\*(C`extproc\*(C'\fR line which specifies shell;
.IP 5. 4
If the executable called by \fBsystem()\fR/\fBexec()\fR/pipe\-\fBopen()\fR/\f(CW\`\`\fR is a script
without "magic" line, and \f(CW$ENV{EXECSHELL}\fR is set to shell;
.IP 6. 4
If the executable called by \fBsystem()\fR/\fBexec()\fR/pipe\-\fBopen()\fR/\f(CW\`\`\fR is not
found (is not this remark obsolete?);
.IP 7. 4
For globbing (see "glob" in perlfunc, "I/O Operators" in perlop)
(obsolete? Perl uses builtin globbing nowadays...).
.PP
For the sake of speed for a common case, in the above algorithms 
backslashes in the command name are not considered as shell metacharacters.
.PP
Perl starts scripts which begin with cookies
\&\f(CW\*(C`extproc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR directly, without an intervention of shell.  Perl uses the
same algorithm to find the executable as \fIpdksh\fR: if the path
on \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR line does not work, and contains \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR, then the directory
part of the executable is ignored, and the executable
is searched in \fI.\fR and on \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR.  To find arguments for these scripts
Perl uses a different algorithm than \fIpdksh\fR: up to 3 arguments are 
recognized, and trailing whitespace is stripped.
.PP
If a script
does not contain such a cooky, then to avoid calling \fIsh.exe\fR, Perl uses
the same algorithm as \fIpdksh\fR: if \f(CW$ENV{EXECSHELL}\fR is set, the
script is given as the first argument to this command, if not set, then
\&\f(CW\*(C`$ENV{COMSPEC} /c\*(C'\fR is used (or a hardwired guess if \f(CW$ENV{COMSPEC}\fR is
not set).
.PP
When starting scripts directly, Perl uses exactly the same algorithm as for 
the search of script given by \fB\-S\fR command-line option: it will look in
the current directory, then on components of \f(CW$ENV{PATH}\fR using the 
following order of appended extensions: no extension, \fI.cmd\fR, \fI.btm\fR, 
\&\fI.bat\fR, \fI.pl\fR.
.PP
Note that Perl will start to look for scripts only if OS/2 cannot start the
specified application, thus \f(CW\*(C`system \*(Aqblah\*(Aq\*(C'\fR will not look for a script if 
there is an executable file \fIblah.exe\fR \fIanywhere\fR on \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR.  In
other words, \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR is essentially searched twice: once by the OS for
an executable, then by Perl for scripts.
.PP
Note also that executable files on OS/2 can have an arbitrary extension, but
\&\fI.exe\fR will be automatically appended if no dot is present in the name.  The
workaround is as simple as that:  since \fIblah.\fR and \fIblah\fR denote the same
file (at list on FAT and HPFS file systems), to start an executable residing in
file \fIn:/bin/blah\fR (no extension) give an argument \f(CW\*(C`n:/bin/blah.\*(C'\fR (dot
appended) to \fBsystem()\fR.
.PP
Perl will start PM programs from VIO (=text\-mode) Perl process in a
separate PM session;
the opposite is not true: when you start a non-PM program from a PM
Perl process, Perl would not run it in a separate session.  If a separate
session is desired, either ensure
that shell will be used, as in \f(CW\*(C`system \*(Aqcmd /c myprog\*(Aq\*(C'\fR, or start it using
optional arguments to \fBsystem()\fR documented in \f(CW\*(C`OS2::Process\*(C'\fR module.  This
is considered to be a feature.

Well, nowadays Perl DLL should be usable from a differently compiled

OS2::REXX), then there are some other aspect of interaction which
are overlooked by the current hackish code to support
differently-compiled principal programs.

Depending on how you built/installed perl you may have (otherwise
identical) Perl documentation in the following formats:

Most probably the most convenient form. Under OS/2 view it as
.PP

.Ve
.PP
(currently the last two may hit a wrong location, but this may improve

.PP
(Expect a lot of errors during the both steps.) Now move it on your
BOOKSHELF path.
.SS "Plain text"

If you have perl documentation in the source form, perl utilities
installed, and GNU groff installed, you may use

.PP
Alternately, try running pod2text on \fI.pod\fR files.
.SS Manpages
.IX Subsection "Manpages"
If you have \fIman\fR installed on your system, and you installed perl
manpages, use something like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        man perlfunc
\&        man 3 less

.Ve
.PP
to access documentation for different components of Perl. Start with
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        man perl
.Ve
.PP
Note that dot (\fI.\fR) is used as a package separator for documentation
for packages, and as usual, sometimes you need to give the section \- \f(CW3\fR
above \- to avoid shadowing by the \fR\f(BIless\fR\fI\|(1) manpage\fR.
.PP
Make sure that the directory \fBabove\fR the directory with manpages is

.SS HTML
.IX Subsection "HTML"
If you have some WWW browser available, installed the Perl
documentation in the source form, and Perl utilities, you can build
HTML docs. Cd to directory with \fI.pod\fR files, and do like this
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        cd f:/perllib/lib/pod
\&        pod2html

After this you can direct your browser the file \fIperl.html\fR in this

Note also that the \fIdb.lib\fR and \fIdb.a\fR from the EMX distribution

If you have \fIexactly the same version of Perl\fR installed already,
make sure that no copies or perl are currently running.  Later steps
of the build may fail since an older version of \fIperl.dll\fR loaded into
memory may be found.  Running \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR becomes meaningless, since
the test are checking a previous build of perl (this situation is detected
and reported by \fIos2/os2_base.t\fR test).  Do not forget to unset

.PP
Also make sure that you have \fI/tmp\fR directory on the current drive,

[This section provides a short overview only...]
.PP
Building should proceed differently depending on whether the version of perl
you install is already present and used on your system, or is a new version
not yet used.  The description below assumes that the version is new, so
installing its DLLs and \fI.pm\fR files will not disrupt the operation of your
system even if some intermediate steps are not yet fully working.
.PP
The other cases require a little bit more convoluted procedures.  Below I
suppose that the current version of Perl is \f(CW5.8.2\fR, so the executables are
named accordingly.
.IP 1. 4
Fully build and test the Perl distribution.  Make sure that no tests are
failing with \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`aout_test\*(C'\fR targets; fix the bugs in Perl and
the Perl test suite detected by these tests.  Make sure that \f(CW\*(C`all_test\*(C'\fR
make target runs as clean as possible.  Check that \fIos2/perlrexx.cmd\fR
runs fine.
.IP 2. 4
Fully install Perl, including \f(CW\*(C`installcmd\*(C'\fR target.  Copy the generated DLLs
to \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATH\*(C'\fR; copy the numbered Perl executables (as in \fIperl5.8.2.exe\fR)
to \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR; copy \f(CW\*(C`perl_.exe\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`perl_5.8.2.exe\*(C'\fR.  Think whether
you need backward-compatibility DLLs.  In most cases you do not need to install
them yet; but sometime this may simplify the following steps.
.IP 3. 4
Make sure that \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR can download files from CPAN.  If not, you may need
to manually install \f(CW\*(C`Net::FTP\*(C'\fR.
.IP 4. 4

.Sp
.Vb 1

This may take a couple of hours on 1GHz processor (when run the first time).

Fix as many discovered bugs as possible.  Document all the bugs which are not
fixed, and all the failures with unknown reasons.  Inspect the produced logs
\&\fI00cpan_i_1\fR to find suspiciously skipped tests, and other fishy events.
.Sp
Keep in mind that \fIinstallation\fR of some modules may fail too: for example,
the DLLs to update may be already loaded by \fICPAN.pm\fR.  Inspect the \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR
logs (in the example above \fI00cpan_i_1\fR etc) for errors, and install things
manually, as in
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  cd $CPANHOME/.cpan/build/Digest\-MD5\-2.31
\&  make install

.Sp
Some distributions may fail some tests, but you may want to install them
anyway (as above, or via \f(CW\*(C`force install\*(C'\fR command of \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR shell-mode).
.Sp
Since this procedure may take quite a long time to complete, it makes sense
to "freeze" your CPAN configuration by disabling periodic updates of the
local copy of CPAN index: set \f(CW\*(C`index_expire\*(C'\fR to some big value (I use 365),
then save the settings
.Sp

can copy \f(CW\*(C`perl5.8.2.exe\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`perl.exe\*(C'\fR, and install the other OMF-build
executables: \f(CW\*(C`perl_\|_.exe\*(C'\fR etc.  They are ready to be used.
.IP 6. 4
Change to the \f(CW\*(C`./pod\*(C'\fR directory of the build tree, download the Perl logo
\&\fICamelGrayBig.BMP\fR, and run
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  ( perl2ipf > perl.ipf ) |& tee 00ipf
\&  ipfc /INF perl.ipf |& tee 00inf
.Ve
.Sp
This produces the Perl docs online book \f(CW\*(C`perl.INF\*(C'\fR.  Install in on
\&\f(CW\*(C`BOOKSHELF\*(C'\fR path.
.IP 7. 4
Now is the time to build statically linked executable \fIperl_.exe\fR which
includes newly-installed via \f(CW\*(C`Bundle::OS2_default\*(C'\fR modules.  Doing testing
via \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR is going to be painfully slow, since it statically links
a new executable per XS extension.
.Sp
Here is a possible workaround: create a toplevel \fIMakefile.PL\fR in
\&\fR\f(CI$CPANHOME\fR\fI/.cpan/build/\fR with contents being (compare with "Making
executables with a custom collection of statically loaded extensions")
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
\&  WriteMakefile NAME => \*(Aqdummy\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
execute this as
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  perl_5.8.2.exe Makefile.PL <nul |& tee 00aout_c1
\&  make \-k all test <nul |& 00aout_t1
.Ve
.Sp
Again, this procedure should not be absolutely smooth.  Some \f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR's
in subdirectories may be buggy, and would not run as "child" scripts.  The
interdependency of modules can strike you; however, since non-XS modules
are already installed, the prerequisites of most modules have a very good
chance to be present.
.Sp
If you discover some glitches, move directories of problematic modules to a
different location; if these modules are non-XS modules, you may just ignore
them \- they are already installed; the remaining, XS, modules you need to
install manually one by one.
.Sp
After each such removal you need to rerun the \f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR process;
usually this procedure converges soon.  (But be sure to convert all the
necessary external C libraries from \fI.lib\fR format to \fI.a\fR format: run one of
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  emxaout foo.lib
\&  emximp \-o foo.a foo.lib
.Ve
.Sp
whichever is appropriate.)  Also, make sure that the DLLs for external
libraries are usable with executables compiled without \f(CW\*(C`\-Zmtd\*(C'\fR options.
.Sp
When you are sure that only a few subdirectories
lead to failures, you may want to add \f(CW\*(C`\-j4\*(C'\fR option to \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR to speed up
skipping subdirectories with already finished build.
.Sp
When you are satisfied with the results of tests, install the build C libraries
for extensions:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  make install |& tee 00aout_i
.Ve
.Sp
Now you can rename the file \fI./perl.exe\fR generated during the last phase
to \fIperl_5.8.2.exe\fR; place it on \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR; if there is an inter-dependency
between some XS modules, you may need to repeat the \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR loop
with this new executable and some excluded modules \- until the procedure
converges.
.Sp
Now you have all the necessary \fI.a\fR libraries for these Perl modules in the
places where Perl builder can find it.  Use the perl builder: change to an
empty directory, create a "dummy" \fIMakefile.PL\fR again, and run
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  perl_5.8.2.exe Makefile.PL |& tee 00c
\&  make perl                  |& tee 00p
.Ve
.Sp
This should create an executable \fI./perl.exe\fR with all the statically loaded
extensions built in.  Compare the generated \fIperlmain.c\fR files to make sure
that during the iterations the number of loaded extensions only increases.
Rename \fI./perl.exe\fR to \fIperl_5.8.2.exe\fR on \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
When it converges, you got a functional variant of \fIperl_5.8.2.exe\fR; copy it
to \f(CW\*(C`perl_.exe\*(C'\fR.  You are done with generation of the local Perl installation.
.IP 8. 4
Make sure that the installed modules are actually installed in the location
of the new Perl, and are not inherited from entries of \f(CW@INC\fR given for
inheritance from the older versions of Perl: set \f(CW\*(C`PERLLIB_582_PREFIX\*(C'\fR to
redirect the new version of Perl to a new location, and copy the installed
files to this new location.  Redo the tests to make sure that the versions of
modules inherited from older versions of Perl are not needed.
.Sp
Actually, the log output of \fBpod2ipf\fR\|(1) during the step 6 gives a very detailed
info about which modules are loaded from which place; so you may use it as
an additional verification tool.
.Sp
Check that some temporary files did not make into the perl install tree.
Run something like this
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  pfind . \-f "!(/\e.(pm|pl|ix|al|h|a|lib|txt|pod|imp|bs|dll|ld|bs|inc|xbm|yml|cgi|uu|e2x|skip|packlist|eg|cfg|html|pub|enc|all|ini|po|pot)$/i or /^\ew+$/") | less
.Ve
.Sp
in the install tree (both top one and \fIsitelib\fR one).
.Sp
Compress all the DLLs with \fIlxlite\fR.  The tiny \fI.exe\fR can be compressed with
\&\f(CW\*(C`/c:max\*(C'\fR (the bug only appears when there is a fixup in the last 6 bytes of a
page (?); since the tiny executables are much smaller than a page, the bug
will not hit).  Do not compress \f(CW\*(C`perl_.exe\*(C'\fR \- it would not work under DOS.
.IP 9. 4
Now you can generate the binary distribution.  This is done by running the
test of the CPAN distribution \f(CW\*(C`OS2::SoftInstaller\*(C'\fR.  Tune up the file
\&\fItest.pl\fR to suit the layout of current version of Perl first.  Do not
forget to pack the necessary external DLLs accordingly.  Include the
description of the bugs and test suite failures you could not fix.  Include
the small-stack versions of Perl executables from Perl build directory.
.Sp
Include \fIperl5.def\fR so that people can relink the perl DLL preserving
the binary compatibility, or can create compatibility DLLs.  Include the diff
files (\f(CW\*(C`diff \-pu old new\*(C'\fR) of fixes you did so that people can rebuild your
version.  Include \fIperl5.map\fR so that one can use remote debugging.
.IP 10. 4

.SS "Making executables with a custom search-paths"
.IX Subsection "Making executables with a custom search-paths"
The default perl executable is flexible enough to support most usages.
However, one may want something yet more flexible; for example, one may want
to find Perl DLL relatively to the location of the EXE file; or one may want
to ignore the environment when setting the Perl-library search patch, etc.
.PP
If you fill comfortable with \fIembedding\fR interface (see perlembed), such
things are easy to do repeating the steps outlined in "Making
executables with a custom collection of statically loaded extensions", and
doing more comprehensive edits to \fBmain()\fR of \fIperlmain.c\fR.  The people with
little desire to understand Perl can just rename \fBmain()\fR, and do necessary
modification in a custom \fBmain()\fR which calls the renamed function in appropriate
time.
.PP
However, there is a third way: perl DLL exports the \fBmain()\fR function and several
callbacks to customize the search path.  Below is a complete example of a
"Perl loader" which
.IP 1. 4
Looks for Perl DLL in the directory \f(CW\*(C`$exedir/../dll\*(C'\fR;
.IP 2. 4
Prepends the above directory to \f(CW\*(C`BEGINLIBPATH\*(C'\fR;
.IP 3. 4
Fails if the Perl DLL found via \f(CW\*(C`BEGINLIBPATH\*(C'\fR is different from what was
loaded on step 1; e.g., another process could have loaded it from \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATH\*(C'\fR
or from a different value of \f(CW\*(C`BEGINLIBPATH\*(C'\fR.  In these cases one needs to
modify the setting of the system so that this other process either does not
run, or loads the DLL from \f(CW\*(C`BEGINLIBPATH\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATHSTRICT=T\*(C'\fR (available
with kernels after September 2000).
.IP 4. 4
Loads Perl library from \f(CW\*(C`$exedir/../dll/lib/\*(C'\fR.
.IP 5. 4
Uses Bourne shell from \f(CW\*(C`$exedir/../dll/sh/ksh.exe\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For best results compile the C file below with the same options as the Perl
DLL.  However, a lot of functionality will work even if the executable is not
an EMX applications, e.g., if compiled with
.PP
.Vb 2

\&\fBWARNING\fR.  Calling \f(CW\*(C`getpriority\*(C'\fR on a non-existing process could lock

Multi-argument form of \f(CWsystem()\fR allows an additional numeric

.PP
When finding a program to run, Perl first asks the OS to look for executables
on \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR (OS/2 adds extension \fI.exe\fR if no extension is present).
If not found, it looks for a script with possible extensions 
added in this order: no extension, \fI.cmd\fR, \fI.btm\fR, 
\&\fI.bat\fR, \fI.pl\fR.  If found, Perl checks the start of the file for magic
strings \f(CW"#!"\fR and \f(CW"extproc "\fR.  If found, Perl uses the rest of the
first line as the beginning of the command line to run this script.  The
only mangling done to the first line is extraction of arguments (currently
up to 3), and ignoring of the path-part of the "interpreter" name if it can't
be found using the full path.
.PP
E.g., \f(CW\*(C`system \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbaz\*(Aq\*(C'\fR may lead Perl to finding
\&\fIC:/emx/bin/foo.cmd\fR with the first line being
.PP
.Vb 1
\& extproc /bin/bash    \-x   \-c
.Ve
.PP
If \fI/bin/bash.exe\fR is not found, then Perl looks for an executable \fIbash.exe\fR on
\&\f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR.  If found in \fIC:/emx.add/bin/bash.exe\fR, then the above \fBsystem()\fR is
translated to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  system qw(C:/emx.add/bin/bash.exe \-x \-c C:/emx/bin/foo.cmd bar baz)
.Ve
.PP
One additional translation is performed: instead of \fI/bin/sh\fR Perl uses
the hardwired-or-customized shell (see "\f(CW\*(C`PERL_SH_DIR\*(C'\fR").
.PP
The above search for "interpreter" is recursive: if \fIbash\fR executable is not
found, but \fIbash.btm\fR is found, Perl will investigate its first line etc.
The only hardwired limit on the recursion depth is implicit: there is a limit
4 on the number of additional arguments inserted before the actual arguments
given to \fBsystem()\fR.  In particular, if no additional arguments are specified
on the "magic" first lines, then the limit on the depth is 4.
.PP
If Perl finds that the found executable is of PM type when the
current session is not, it will start the new process in a separate session of
necessary type.  Call via \f(CW\*(C`OS2::Process\*(C'\fR to disable this magic.
.PP
\&\fBWARNING\fR.  Due to the described logic, you need to explicitly
specify \fI.com\fR extension if needed.  Moreover, if the executable

.IP \(bu 4
Apparently, IBM used a compiler (for some period of time around '95?) which
changes FP mask right and left.  This is not \fIthat\fR bad for IBM's
programs, but the same compiler was used for DLLs which are used with
general-purpose applications.  When these DLLs are used, the state of
floating-point flags in the application is not predictable.
.Sp
What is much worse, some DLLs change the floating point flags when in
\&\fB_DLLInitTerm()\fR (e.g., \fITCP32IP\fR).  This means that even if you do not \fIcall\fR
any function in the DLL, just the act of loading this DLL will reset your
flags.  What is worse, the same compiler was used to compile some HOOK DLLs.
Given that HOOK dlls are executed in the context of \fIall\fR the applications
in the system, this means a complete unpredictability of floating point
flags on systems using such HOOK DLLs.  E.g., \fIGAMESRVR.DLL\fR of \fBDIVE\fR
origin changes the floating point flags on each write to the TTY of a VIO
(windowed text-mode) applications.
.Sp
Some other (not completely debugged) situations when FP flags change include
some video drivers (?), and some operations related to creation of the windows.
People who code \fBOpenGL\fR may have more experience on this.
.Sp
Perl is generally used in the situation when all the floating-point
exceptions are ignored, as is the default under EMX.  If they are not ignored,
some benign Perl programs would get a \f(CW\*(C`SIGFPE\*(C'\fR and would die a horrible death.
.Sp
To circumvent this, Perl uses two hacks.  They help against \fIone\fR type of
damage only: FP flags changed when loading a DLL.
.Sp
One of the hacks is to disable floating point exceptions on Perl startup (as
is the default with EMX).  This helps only with compile-time-linked DLLs
changing the flags before \fBmain()\fR had a chance to be called.
.Sp
The other hack is to restore FP flags after a call to \fBdlopen()\fR.  This helps
against similar damage done by DLLs \fB_DLLInitTerm()\fR at runtime.  Currently
no way to switch these hacks off is provided.

.IP "Treating errors reported by OS/2 API" 4
.IX Item "Treating errors reported by OS/2 API"
There are two principal conventions (it is useful to call them \f(CW\*(C`Dos*\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`Win*\*(C'\fR \- though this part of the function signature is not always
determined by the name of the API) of reporting the error conditions
of OS/2 API.  Most of \f(CW\*(C`Dos*\*(C'\fR APIs report the error code as the result
of the call (so 0 means success, and there are many types of errors).
Most of \f(CW\*(C`Win*\*(C'\fR API report success/fail via the result being
\&\f(CW\*(C`TRUE\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`FALSE\*(C'\fR; to find the reason for the failure one should call
\&\fBWinGetLastError()\fR API.
.Sp
Some \f(CW\*(C`Win*\*(C'\fR entry points also overload a "meaningful" return value
with the error indicator; having a 0 return value indicates an error.
Yet some other \f(CW\*(C`Win*\*(C'\fR entry points overload things even more, and 0
return value may mean a successful call returning a valid value 0, as
well as an error condition; in the case of a 0 return value one should
call \fBWinGetLastError()\fR API to distinguish a successful call from a
failing one.
.Sp
By convention, all the calls to OS/2 API should indicate their
failures by resetting $^E.  All the Perl-accessible functions which
call OS/2 API may be broken into two classes: some \fBdie()\fRs when an API
error is encountered, the other report the error via a false return
value (of course, this does not concern Perl-accessible functions
which \fIexpect\fR a failure of the OS/2 API call, having some workarounds
coded).
.Sp
Obviously, in the situation of the last type of the signature of an OS/2
API, it is must more convenient for the users if the failure is
indicated by \fBdie()\fRing: one does not need to check $^E to know that
something went wrong.  If, however, this solution is not desirable by
some reason, the code in question should reset $^E to 0 before making
this OS/2 API call, so that the caller of this Perl-accessible
function has a chance to distinguish a success\-but\-0\-return value from
a failure.  (One may return undef as an alternative way of reporting
an error.)

This is the same executable as \fIperl_\|_\|_.exe\fR, but it is a PM
application.
.PP
\&\fBNote.\fR Usually (unless explicitly redirected during the startup)
STDIN, STDERR, and STDOUT of a PM
application are redirected to \fInul\fR. However, it is possible to \fIsee\fR
them if you start \f(CW\*(C`perl_\|_.exe\*(C'\fR from a PM program which emulates a
console window, like \fIShell mode\fR of Emacs or EPM. Thus it \fIis
possible\fR to use Perl debugger (see perldebug) to debug your PM
application (but beware of the message loop lockups \- this will not
work if you have a message queue to serve, unless you hook the serving
into the \fBgetc()\fR function of the debugger).
.PP
Another way to see the output of a PM program is to run it as
.PP
.Vb 1

.PP
with a shell \fIdifferent\fR from \fIcmd.exe\fR, so that it does not create
a link between a VIO session and the session of \f(CW\*(C`pm_porg\*(C'\fR.  (Such a link
closes the VIO window.)  E.g., this works with \fIsh.exe\fR \- or with Perl!
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  open P, \*(Aqpm_prog args 2>&1 |\*(Aq or die;

The flavor \fIperl_\|_.exe\fR is required if you want to start your program without
a VIO window present, but not \f(CW\*(C`detach\*(C'\fRed (run \f(CW\*(C`help detach\*(C'\fR for more info).
Very useful for extensions which use PM, like \f(CW\*(C`Perl/Tk\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`OpenGL\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Note also that the differences between PM and VIO executables are only
in the \fIdefault\fR behaviour.  One can start \fIany\fR executable in

.SS "Why strange names?"
.IX Subsection "Why strange names?"
Since Perl processes the \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR\-line (cf. 
"DESCRIPTION" in perlrun, "Command Switches" in perlrun,
"No Perl script found in input" in perldiag), it should know when a
program \fIis a Perl\fR. There is some naming convention which allows
Perl to distinguish correct lines from wrong ones. The above names are
almost the only names allowed by this convention which do not contain
digits (which have absolutely different semantics).
.SS "Why dynamic linking?"
.IX Subsection "Why dynamic linking?"
Well, having several executables dynamically linked to the same huge
library has its advantages, but this would not substantiate the
additional work to make it compile. The reason is the complicated-to-developers
but very quick and convenient-to-users "hard" dynamic linking used by OS/2.
.PP
There are two distinctive features of the dyna-linking model of OS/2:
first, all the references to external functions are resolved at the compile time;
second, there is no runtime fixup of the DLLs after they are loaded into memory.
The first feature is an enormous advantage over other models: it avoids
conflicts when several DLLs used by an application export entries with
the same name.  In such cases "other" models of dyna-linking just choose
between these two entry points using some random criterion \- with predictable
disasters as results.  But it is the second feature which requires the build
of \fIperl.dll\fR.
.PP
The address tables of DLLs are patched only once, when they are
loaded. The addresses of the entry points into DLLs are guaranteed to be
the same for all the programs which use the same DLL.  This removes the
runtime fixup \- once DLL is loaded, its code is read-only.
.PP
While this allows some (significant?) performance advantages, this makes life
much harder for developers, since the above scheme makes it impossible
for a DLL to be "linked" to a symbol in the \fI.EXE\fR file.  Indeed, this
would need a DLL to have different relocations tables for the
(different) executables which use this DLL.
.PP
However, a dynamically loaded Perl extension is forced to use some symbols
from the perl
executable, e.g., to know how to find the arguments to the functions:
the arguments live on the perl
internal evaluation stack. The solution is to put the main code of
the interpreter into a DLL, and make the \fI.EXE\fR file which just loads
this DLL into memory and supplies command-arguments.  The extension DLL
cannot link to symbols in \fI.EXE\fR, but it has no problem linking
to symbols in the \fI.DLL\fR.
.PP
This \fIgreatly\fR increases the load time for the application (as well as
complexity of the compilation). Since interpreter is in a DLL,
the C RTL is basically forced to reside in a DLL as well (otherwise
extensions would not be able to use CRT).  There are some advantages if
you use different flavors of perl, such as running \fIperl.exe\fR and
\&\fIperl_\|_.exe\fR simultaneously: they share the memory of \fIperl.dll\fR.
.PP
\&\fBNOTE\fR.  There is one additional effect which makes DLLs more wasteful:
DLLs are loaded in the shared memory region, which is a scarse resource
given the 512M barrier of the "standard" OS/2 virtual memory.  The code of
\&\fI.EXE\fR files is also shared by all the processes which use the particular
\&\fI.EXE\fR, but they are "shared in the private address space of the process";
this is possible because the address at which different sections
of the \fI.EXE\fR file are loaded is decided at compile-time, thus all the
processes have these sections loaded at same addresses, and no fixup
of internal links inside the \fI.EXE\fR is needed.
.PP
Since DLLs may be loaded at run time, to have the same mechanism for DLLs
one needs to have the address range of \fIany of the loaded\fR DLLs in the
system to be available \fIin all the processes\fR which did not load a particular
DLL yet.  This is why the DLLs are mapped to the shared memory region.
.SS "Why chimera build?"
.IX Subsection "Why chimera build?"
Current EMX environment does not allow DLLs compiled using Unixish
\&\f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR format to export symbols for data (or at least some types of
data). This forces \f(CW\*(C`omf\*(C'\fR\-style compile of \fIperl.dll\fR.
.PP
Current EMX environment does not allow \fI.EXE\fR files compiled in
\&\f(CW\*(C`omf\*(C'\fR format to \fBfork()\fR. \fBfork()\fR is needed for exactly three Perl
operations:

.IX Subsection "DLL name mangling: pre 5.6.2"
With the release 5.003_01 the dynamically loadable libraries

DLLs (including \fIperl.dll\fR) are now created with the names
which contain a checksum, thus allowing workaround for OS/2 scheme of
caching DLLs.

It may be possible to code a simple workaround which would
.IP \(bu 4

.IP \(bu 4
mangle the names according to the scheme of new perl and copy the DLLs to
these names;
.IP \(bu 4

.IP \(bu 4

.SS "DLL name mangling: 5.6.2 and beyond"
.IX Subsection "DLL name mangling: 5.6.2 and beyond"
In fact mangling of \fIextension\fR DLLs was done due to misunderstanding
of the OS/2 dynaloading model.  OS/2 (effectively) maintains two
different tables of loaded DLL:
.IP "Global DLLs" 4
.IX Item "Global DLLs"
those loaded by the base name from \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATH\*(C'\fR; including those
associated at link time;
.IP "specific DLLs" 4
.IX Item "specific DLLs"
loaded by the full name.
.PP
When resolving a request for a global DLL, the table of already-loaded
specific DLLs is (effectively) ignored; moreover, specific DLLs are
\&\fIalways\fR loaded from the prescribed path.
.PP
There is/was a minor twist which makes this scheme fragile: what to do
with DLLs loaded from
.ie n .IP """BEGINLIBPATH"" and ""ENDLIBPATH""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWBEGINLIBPATH\fR and \f(CWENDLIBPATH\fR" 4
.IX Item "BEGINLIBPATH and ENDLIBPATH"
(which depend on the process)
.ie n .IP "\fI.\fR from ""LIBPATH""" 4
.el .IP "\fI.\fR from \f(CWLIBPATH\fR" 4
.IX Item ". from LIBPATH"
which \fIeffectively\fR depends on the process (although \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATH\*(C'\fR is the
same for all the processes).
.PP
Unless \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATHSTRICT\*(C'\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`T\*(C'\fR (and the kernel is after
2000/09/01), such DLLs are considered to be global.  When loading a
global DLL it is first looked in the table of already-loaded global
DLLs.  Because of this the fact that one executable loaded a DLL from
\&\f(CW\*(C`BEGINLIBPATH\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ENDLIBPATH\*(C'\fR, or \fI.\fR from \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATH\*(C'\fR may affect
\&\fIwhich\fR DLL is loaded when \fIanother\fR executable requests a DLL with
the same name.  \fIThis\fR is the reason for version-specific mangling of
the DLL name for perl DLL.
.PP
Since the Perl extension DLLs are always loaded with the full path,
there is no need to mangle their names in a version-specific ways:
their directory already reflects the corresponding version of perl,
and \f(CW@INC\fR takes into account binary compatibility with older version.
Starting from \f(CW5.6.2\fR the name mangling scheme is fixed to be the
same as for Perl 5.005_53 (same as in a popular binary release).  Thus
new Perls will be able to \fIresolve the names\fR of old extension DLLs
if \f(CW@INC\fR allows finding their directories.
.PP
However, this still does not guarantee that these DLL may be loaded.
The reason is the mangling of the name of the \fIPerl DLL\fR.  And since
the extension DLLs link with the Perl DLL, extension DLLs for older
versions would load an older Perl DLL, and would most probably
segfault (since the data in this DLL is not properly initialized).
.PP
There is a partial workaround (which can be made complete with newer
OS/2 kernels): create a forwarder DLL with the same name as the DLL of
the older version of Perl, which forwards the entry points to the
newer Perl's DLL.  Make this DLL accessible on (say) the \f(CW\*(C`BEGINLIBPATH\*(C'\fR of
the new Perl executable.  When the new executable accesses old Perl's
extension DLLs, they would request the old Perl's DLL by name, get the
forwarder instead, so effectively will link with the currently running
(new) Perl DLL.
.PP
This may break in two ways:
.IP \(bu 4
Old perl executable is started when a new executable is running has
loaded an extension compiled for the old executable (ouph!).  In this
case the old executable will get a forwarder DLL instead of the old
perl DLL, so would link with the new perl DLL.  While not directly
fatal, it will behave the same as new executable.  This beats the whole
purpose of explicitly starting an old executable.
.IP \(bu 4
A new executable loads an extension compiled for the old executable
when an old perl executable is running.  In this case the extension
will not pick up the forwarder \- with fatal results.
.PP
With support for \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATHSTRICT\*(C'\fR this may be circumvented \- unless
one of DLLs is started from \fI.\fR from \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATH\*(C'\fR (I do not know
whether \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATHSTRICT\*(C'\fR affects this case).
.PP
\&\fBREMARK\fR.  Unless newer kernels allow \fI.\fR in \f(CW\*(C`BEGINLIBPATH\*(C'\fR (older
do not), this mess cannot be completely cleaned.  (It turns out that
as of the beginning of 2002, \fI.\fR is not allowed, but \fI.\e.\fR is \- and
it has the same effect.)
.PP
\&\fBREMARK\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`LIBPATHSTRICT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`BEGINLIBPATH\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ENDLIBPATH\*(C'\fR are
not environment variables, although \fIcmd.exe\fR emulates them on \f(CW\*(C`SET

.SS "Calls to external programs"
.IX Subsection "Calls to external programs"
Due to a popular demand the perl external program calling has been
changed wrt Andreas Kaiser's port.  \fIIf\fR perl needs to call an
external program \fIvia shell\fR, the \fIf:/bin/sh.exe\fR will be called, or
whatever is the override, see "\f(CW\*(C`PERL_SH_DIR\*(C'\fR".
.PP
Thus means that you need to get some copy of a \fIsh.exe\fR as well (I
use one from pdksh). The path \fIF:/bin\fR above is set up automatically during
the build to a correct value on the builder machine, but is
overridable at runtime,
.PP
\&\fBReasons:\fR a consensus on \f(CW\*(C`perl5\-porters\*(C'\fR was that perl should use
one non-overridable shell per platform. The obvious choices for OS/2
are \fIcmd.exe\fR and \fIsh.exe\fR. Having perl build itself would be impossible
with \fIcmd.exe\fR as a shell, thus I picked up \f(CW\*(C`sh.exe\*(C'\fR. This assures almost
100% compatibility with the scripts coming from *nix. As an added benefit 
this works as well under DOS if you use DOS-enabled port of pdksh 
(see "Prerequisites").
.PP
\&\fBDisadvantages:\fR currently \fIsh.exe\fR of pdksh calls external programs
via \fBfork()\fR/\fBexec()\fR, and there is \fIno\fR functioning \fBexec()\fR on
OS/2. \fBexec()\fR is emulated by EMX by an asynchronous call while the caller
waits for child completion (to pretend that the \f(CW\*(C`pid\*(C'\fR did not change). This
means that 1 \fIextra\fR copy of \fIsh.exe\fR is made active via \fBfork()\fR/\fBexec()\fR,
which may lead to some resources taken from the system (even if we do
not count extra work needed for \fBfork()\fRing).
.PP
Note that this a lesser issue now when we do not spawn \fIsh.exe\fR
unless needed (metachars found).
.PP
One can always start \fIcmd.exe\fR explicitly via
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  system \*(Aqcmd\*(Aq, \*(Aq/c\*(Aq, \*(Aqmycmd\*(Aq, \*(Aqarg1\*(Aq, \*(Aqarg2\*(Aq, ...

If you need to use \fIcmd.exe\fR, and do not want to hand-edit thousands of your

.PP
which will override \fBsystem()\fR, \fBexec()\fR, \f(CW\`\`\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`open(,\*(Aq...|\*(Aq)\*(C'\fR. With current perl you may override only \fBsystem()\fR,
\&\fBreadpipe()\fR \- the explicit version of \f(CW\`\`\fR, and maybe \fBexec()\fR. The code
will substitute the one-argument call to \fBsystem()\fR by
\&\f(CW\*(C`CORE::system(\*(Aqcmd.exe\*(Aq, \*(Aq/c\*(Aq, shift)\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If you have some working code for \f(CW\*(C`OS2::Cmd\*(C'\fR, please send it to me,

cannot test it.
.PP
For the details of the current situation with calling external programs,
see "Starting OS/2 (and DOS) programs under Perl".  Set us
mention a couple of features:
.IP \(bu 4
External scripts may be called by their basename.  Perl will try the same
extensions as when processing \fB\-S\fR command-line switch.
.IP \(bu 4
External scripts starting with \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`extproc \*(C'\fR will be executed directly,
without calling the shell, by calling the program specified on the rest of

.SS "Memory allocation"
.IX Subsection "Memory allocation"
Perl uses its own \fBmalloc()\fR under OS/2 \- interpreters are usually malloc-bound
for speed, but perl is not, since its malloc is lightning-fast.
Perl-memory-usage-tuned benchmarks show that Perl's malloc is 5 times quicker
than EMX one.  I do not have convincing data about memory footprint, but
a (pretty random) benchmark showed that Perl's one is 5% better.
.PP
Combination of perl's \fBmalloc()\fR and rigid DLL name resolution creates
a special problem with library functions which expect their return value to
be \fBfree()\fRd by system's \fBfree()\fR. To facilitate extensions which need to call 
such functions, system memory-allocation functions are still available with
the prefix \f(CW\*(C`emx_\*(C'\fR added. (Currently only DLL perl has this, it should
